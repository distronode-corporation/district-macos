Used by scripts/release-preflight.sh (highest-build and train-open, before anything is
built), .github/workflows/release.yml (wait-valid after the upload), scripts/direct-release.sh
(profile, when the Developer ID export signs manually) and submit.yml (submit).

Copied from district-ios's script of the same name. The differences: PLATFORM is MAC_OS
(the Mac app is the same App Store Connect app as the iPhone and iPad app, a universal
purchase, so every query that could match an iOS record filters by platform), and the
`train-open`, `profile` commands are new. The GitHub Release helpers are not carried
over yet.

Standard library only: the ES256 signature is made by the `openssl` binary and every HTTP
call goes through `curl`, so the script needs no pip install and no pinned dependency.

The .p8 is read by openssl from its path and never by this process; the bearer token
reaches curl on stdin (`-K -`), never on argv, which is world-readable through `ps`.

`submit` is written to be re-run after a partial failure: every step reads the current
state first and does only what is missing, and a version that is already waiting for or
in review is reported and left alone rather than submitted twice.
