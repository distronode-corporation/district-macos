/// A transport that answers by OPERATION rather than by position in a queue.
///
/// ⛔ A QUEUE CANNOT MODEL THESE SCREENS, AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THESE TESTS PROVED IT.
/// Every scheduling model issues its independent reads inside a `withTaskGroup`, so the
/// order they reach the transport in is genuinely nondeterministic, a positional
/// `SettingsTransport` handed the calendar's refusal to whichever request happened to
/// arrive third, and the assertions passed or failed on scheduler timing. Routing on the
/// `op` name makes each read's answer stable no matter what order they run in, which is
/// the only way to assert "one row failed and the others survived" at all.
///
/// ⚠️ IT STILL RECORDS EVERY REQUEST, so a test can assert WHICH ops a model sent and how
/// many, which is the property that catches a model quietly adding or dropping a read.
///
/// ⛔ AND AN UNCONFIGURED OP ANSWERS 500 RATHER THAN HANGING OR CRASHING. A model that
/// grows a read its test did not anticipate fails on an assertion about behaviour instead
/// of on a fatal error somewhere inside the client.
