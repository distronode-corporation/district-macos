/// ⛔ THE GUARD ON THE ANCHOR, WHICH IS THE ONE THING A COMPILER CANNOT CHECK HERE.
/// `DistrictFont` requires a `style`, so no token can be written without one, but a
/// fifteenth token could be added as a raw `Font.system(...)`, which compiles, renders
/// identically at the default text size, and is then the single label on the app that
/// never grows. Nothing would fail. This pins the COUNT of `allScalable`, so a token
/// missing from that list is a red test rather than a silent hole.
///
/// ⚠️ Swift cannot enumerate a caseless enum's static members, `Mirror` reflects
/// instances, so the list is hand-maintained and this test is what keeps it honest.
