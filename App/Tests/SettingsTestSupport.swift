/// ⛔ ITS OWN COPY IN THE APP TARGET RATHER THAN A SHARED ONE. `DistrictCore`'s
/// `RepositoryTransport` lives in that package's TEST target, which nothing outside it
/// can import, a test bundle is not a product. The alternative was moving a test helper
/// into shipping code, which is a worse trade than thirty lines.
///
/// ⛔ AND IT RECORDS BODIES, WHICH IS THE POINT FOR HALF THIS SURFACE. "Did this save
/// carry the engine id", "did an unreadable rule go back unchanged" and "was a cleared
/// voice sent as an empty string" are all questions about the encoded document rather
/// than about arguments, and `JSONValue.object(_:)` drops a nil pair silently by
/// design, so only the bytes can answer them.
