/// ⛔ ITS OWN TYPE RATHER THAN `SettingsTransport`, FOR ONE REASON THAT MATTERS:
/// that helper applies ONE status to every queued body, and half of what is under
/// test here is the difference between a **200** carrying `{ok:false}` (the
/// scheduler refused) and a real 403 (our route refused). A harness that cannot
/// express both cannot tell the two failures apart, which is exactly the
/// distinction `SchedulingAdminError` exists to preserve.
///
/// ⛔ AND IT DECODES THE SENT BODY INTO `op` AND `params`, BECAUSE THAT IS THE
/// ASSERTION. Every op crosses the wire as a STRING inside one descriptor, so
/// "did this sheet send `apiKeys.create` with `{name}`" is a question about the
/// encoded document and nothing typed can answer it. `JSONValue.object(_:)` drops
/// a nil pair silently by design, so an absent key is only visible in the bytes.
