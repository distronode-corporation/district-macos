/// The fixtures and the one assertion every scheduling-write test is built on.
///
/// ⛔ THE ASSERTION IS ABOUT THE `op` AND THE `params`, WHICH IS THE ONLY PLACE
/// THE ANSWER IS. All 75 scheduling admin ops cross the wire through ONE endpoint
/// as `{workspaceId, op, params}`, so "did the editor send a create or a patch",
/// "did the create carry the fourteen fields it must not" and "was the group
/// delete addressed by `groupId` rather than `group_id`" are questions about the
/// encoded document. The repository names no URL per op and no typed model can be
/// inspected for it.
///
/// ⛔ AND THE BODY IS PARSED, NEVER SUBSTRING-MATCHED. `JSONValue.object(_:)` is
/// backed by a DICTIONARY, so key order is not a promise; a test asserting
/// `contains("\"slug\":\"x\",\"name\"")` would pass or fail on hash seeding.
///
/// ⚠️ IT REUSES `SettingsTransport` rather than declaring a second stub. That type
/// already queues bodies and records requests, which is the whole requirement, and
/// a queue that has run dry answers 500, so a test that drives one request too
/// many fails on an assertion instead of hanging.
