/// The App Store Review Guideline 3.1.1 anti-steering gate for every sentence this app
/// says.
///
/// Ported from district-ios (see PORTING.md). ⛔ IT HOLDS BOTH MAC BUILDS: the Developer ID
/// build compiles the same `App/Sources` under the same bundle id as the store build, so a
/// sentence that would be rejected in one is shipped in both. ⚠️ The Mac's allowlist is
/// the iOS one minus the files that are not ported yet (Marketplace, Wave 8; the Desk's
/// entry arrives with the Desk) and minus the sign-in button's disclosure, which the Mac's
/// sign-in screen does not carry, because a stale entry fails
/// ``testTheAllowlistHasNoStaleEntry``.
///
/// ⛔ 3.1.1 FORBIDS THE SIGNPOST, NOT ONLY THE BUTTON. Prose is not the safe half of the
/// rule: a sentence telling a customer that plan changes happen "on the web dashboard at
/// distronode.com" steers them to an outside purchase just as surely as a link would, and
/// it does it in the one form no reviewer needs to tap to find. Every user-visible string
/// states the LIMITATION and names no destination.
///
/// ⛔ A SCAN RATHER THAN EQUALITY ASSERTIONS, BECAUSE THE RISK IS THE NEXT STRING. Pinning
/// today's strings proves nothing about tomorrow's, and a screen written in a hurry
/// reaches for "you can do that on the website" by reflex. So this reads the SOURCE of every file under
/// `App/Sources/Features` and `App/Sources/Navigation`, pulls out the string literals, and
/// fails on any that names the web, a browser, a dashboard, a console or distronode.com.
/// The direct assertions at the bottom are a second, independent hold on the
/// sentences a reviewer is most likely to read first.
///
/// ⚠️ DOC COMMENTS ARE SKIPPED ON PURPOSE, AND THIS FILE IS THE PROOF THAT THEY MUST BE.
/// The reasoning above cannot be written without the words it forbids, and the same is
/// true of every ⛔ that records why a string says what it says. A line whose first
/// non-space characters are `//` is not shown to anyone, so it is not scanned.
///
/// ⛔ THREE EXCEPTIONS ARE DELIBERATE AND ARE NOT LOOPHOLES:
///   - `Features/Account/AccountView.swift`, the account-deletion row says "Opens in your
///     browser" and opens a distronode.com page. Guideline 5.1.1(v) REQUIRES
///     an account-deletion path, the web page is that path, and telling a person the tap
///     leaves the app is honesty about what the control does rather than steering toward a
///     purchase. Pinned to Android and to both store listings.
///   - `Features/Scheduling/**`, a hand-off into OUR OWN product. Nothing there names a
///     place today; the exemption keeps this gate out of that feature's way rather than
///     blessing anything.
///   - `Features/Dialer/DialerCopy.swift`'s emergency line, which hands the caller to the
///     Phone app. Not listed below because "Phone app" is not one of the forbidden words;
///     it is named here so nobody removes it thinking this gate wants it gone.
///
/// ⚠️ THE REMAINING ALLOWANCES ARE FIELD LABELS (on iOS also a sign-in disclosure), none of
/// which tell anyone where to go instead: a contact's own website, and, as their sections
/// are ported, the A2P form's website field and the customer's browser loading a logo we
/// host. Each is listed by its exact text, and ``testTheAllowlistHasNoStaleEntry``
/// fails if one stops occurring, so the list cannot quietly grow slack.
