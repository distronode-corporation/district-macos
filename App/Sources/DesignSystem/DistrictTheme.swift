import SwiftUI

/// The Ledger palette, ported from the web.
///
/// ⛔ THE SOURCE OF TRUTH IS THE WEB'S LEDGER TOKEN TABLE (`tokens.css`), NOT THIS
/// FILE AND NOT ANY DASHBOARD STYLESHEET. That one table is what the web dashboard
/// and both native `DistrictColors` pairs are written from. Change a value there
/// first, then carry it here. If they ever disagree, `tokens.css` wins.
///
/// ⚠️ THE ANDROID CLIENT'S `DistrictColors.kt` MOVES IN ITS OWN CHANGE, so the two
/// native palettes are not guaranteed byte-identical at any moment. Compare either
/// client against `tokens.css`, never against the other.
///
/// ⛔ THERE IS EXACTLY ONE ACCENT. `district` is used for links and the
/// answered-in-region mark and nothing else; every other emphasis on this palette
/// is carried by `filled` on the web and by weight, rule and band here. Do not
/// reintroduce a second brand colour, a glow token or a decorative cyan.
///
/// ⚠️ DARK IS THE REAL THEME. Dark is designed rather than inverted, and the light
/// palette exists for parity; the light values are separately darkened for contrast
/// on white rather than being the dark values lightened, so the two are not
/// mechanically derivable from each other, which is why both are written out.
///
/// ⚠️ ONE WEB TOKEN HAS NO HOME HERE. `--filled` / `--filled-foreground` (the web's
/// table header row and primary button) has no field on this struct, so it is not
/// ported; ``DistrictButton`` still fills its primary style with ``district``. That
/// is a known divergence from the web's button, not an omission to quietly patch by
/// pointing an existing token at a `filled` value.
///
/// ⛔ NO ASSET CATALOG AND NO `UIColor(dynamicProvider:)`. Both would drag UIKit
/// into a directory whose whole point is that it depends on nothing but SwiftUI.
/// The palette is resolved once, from `colorScheme`, by ``View/districtTheme()``
/// and handed down the environment instead.
