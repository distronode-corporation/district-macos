import SwiftUI

/// One list row: optional leading slot, title, optional subtitle, optional trailing
/// slot. Ported from Android's `DistrictListRow.kt`.
///
/// ⛔ THE TRAILING SLOT SITS NEXT TO THE TEXT, NOT AT THE SCREEN EDGE. The Android
/// rows were full-bleed, so each row's status ended up an inch from the name it
/// described with an empty desert between them. Capping the text column and giving
/// the row a trailing slot are two halves of one fix.
///
/// ⛔ NO `onTap` PARAMETER, DELIBERATELY, AND IT IS NOT AN OMISSION. On iOS a
/// tappable row is a `NavigationLink` or a `Button` WRAPPING this view, which is
/// what gives it the disclosure affordance, the press highlight, the accessibility
/// button trait and the swipe actions a `List` provides. A tap gesture attached in
/// here would give none of those and would fight the enclosing `List` for the
/// gesture.
///
/// ⚠️ NO POINTER EFFECT HERE, FOR THE SAME REASON THERE IS NO TAP. The `List` cell, the
/// `NavigationLink` or the `Button` wrapping this row already answers the pointer, and a
/// second effect on the content would draw two highlights, one inside the other.
///
/// ⚠️ 56pt minimum, not the 44pt touch-target floor. Two lines of text need more
/// than 44pt before they start to feel wedged in, and most rows here have a
/// subtitle.
///
/// ⛔ THE TEXT COLUMN YIELDS AND THE TRAILING SLOT DOES NOT, AND THAT ORDERING HAS TO
/// BE STATED OR `HStack` SPLITS THE SHORTFALL BETWEEN THEM. Once, nothing
/// here expressed it: every subview sat at layout priority 0, so when the children's
/// ideal widths exceeded the row, `HStack` proposed each of them a proportional share
/// and every `Text` in the row complied by WRAPPING. On the call log that rendered as
/// "Transferr/ed" and "complet/ed" in the pills AND a two-line subtitle at the same
/// time, on exactly the rows carrying two pills; one-pill rows were fine because their
/// ideal widths still fitted, which is what made it look like a badge bug rather than
/// a row-layout one.
///
/// ⚠️ `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)` ON THE TEXT COLUMN DOES NOT MAKE IT YIELD. It makes
/// it GREEDY, and greed only decides who takes the SURPLUS. Under a shortfall the frame
/// passes the reduced proposal straight through to the `Text`s inside it.
///
/// So: the trailing slot is sized first against the full available width and the
/// remainder goes to the text column; and `lineLimit(1)` on both `Text`s, so the column
/// that yields TRUNCATES rather than growing the row. ``DistrictBadge`` holds the other
/// half, keeping one pill's label on one line.
///
/// ⚠️ MAC: THE ARRANGEMENT IS ``DistrictRowLayout``, NOT AN `HStack` WITH
/// `layoutPriority(1)` AS ON THE iPad. It keeps that ordering while the title fits beside
/// the trailing slot, and moves the slot under the text when it does not, so a narrow list
/// column truncates neither the name nor (with `subtitleMustFit`) the date.
///
/// ⛔ AND THE TRAILING SLOT IS DELIBERATELY NOT `fixedSize`. That would pin it to its
/// ideal width against any proposal, which is right for two pills and wrong for
/// ``ConversationRow``, whose trailing slot can emit FIVE (channel labels, status,
/// "Draft", the unread count): a fixed-size slot wider than the row pushes the text
/// column to zero and overflows the right edge, where content is unreachable rather
/// than merely cramped. Priority gives the pills their full width whenever it exists
/// and lets the slot compress only when nothing else can, which is the honest ordering.
