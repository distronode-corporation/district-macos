/// MOVED. The Ledger fills its primary button with `--filled` / `--filled-foreground`,
/// a token ``DistrictColors`` does not carry. This stays on the accent until that
/// token is added deliberately.
///
/// ⚠️ `destructive` IS A TINTED OUTLINE, NOT A RED FILL. The web uses
/// `bg-destructive/10 text-destructive border-destructive/25`, because a solid red
/// fill reads as "this already went wrong" rather than "this action is
/// destructive". The solid destructive colour is reserved for actual error
