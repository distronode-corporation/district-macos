/// ⛔ THE ANDROID CLIENT HAD NO SUCH COMPONENT, WHICH IS WHY AN EMPTY SCREEN READ AS
/// A BROKEN ONE. An empty list rendered as a blank expanse, indistinguishable from a
/// failed load, and a user cannot tell "you have no contacts yet" from "this did not
/// work" by looking at nothing. Every list in this app can reach that state on day
/// one of a new workspace, which is the first thing a new customer sees. Pair it
/// with ``FailureView``: an absence and a failure are different answers and must
/// never share a screen state.
///
/// ⚠️ Takes an optional action so the empty state can be WHERE the first item is
/// created, rather than a dead end describing a button somewhere else.
///
/// ⛔ THAT ACTION MAY NEVER BE A PURCHASE PATH. App Store Review Guideline 3.1.3(b)
/// forbids it and billing is read-only in this app: a lapsed workspace gets a
/// sentence naming the website and stops there.
