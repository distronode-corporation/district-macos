/// The type scale, mirroring the Android client's `DistrictType.kt`.
///
/// ⛔ THE SYSTEM FACE, NOT GEIST, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE FROM ANDROID.
/// The web ships Geist through `next/font/google`; the Android client bundles three
/// static TTFs because Compose cannot consume woff2. Bundling them here would mean
/// adding font files to the app target and a `UIAppFonts` key to `Info.plist`,
/// which is generated from `project.yml`. San Francisco at the same sizes and
/// weights is the honest interim: the scale is what the layouts are built on, and
/// the face can be swapped in one file later without moving a single call site.
///
/// ⚠️ SIZES COME FROM REAL COMPONENTS, NOT FROM A DEFAULT TABLE. The web sets no
/// custom type scale, so the anchors are the components themselves: `PageHeader` is
/// `text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold`, the login card title is
/// `text-3xl md:text-4xl`, buttons are `text-sm`/`text-xs`, body copy is
/// `text-base`. Each value below is the Kotlin port's, so the two clients render
/// the same hierarchy.
///
/// ⚠️ WEIGHTS ARE 400/600/700 ONLY. Android is limited to those three because they
/// are the cuts it vendors; matching the limit here keeps a design that reads the
/// same on both clients rather than one that quietly uses a weight the other
/// cannot render.
/// One text style: the size and weight we chose, plus the system style its scaling
/// is anchored to.
///
/// ⛔ A DESCRIPTOR RATHER THAN A `Font`, AND THE REASON IS THAT THE OBVIOUS API DOES
/// NOT EXIST. The natural move is `Font.system(size:weight:design:relativeTo:)`,
/// compiled against the iOS 17 SDK it is `error: extra argument 'relativeTo' in
/// call`. `relativeTo:` lives on `Font.custom(_:size:relativeTo:)`, which needs a
/// bundled font file this app deliberately does not ship, and on `@ScaledMetric`,
/// which is a property wrapper and therefore needs a view. So the size travels as
/// DATA to a modifier that owns the wrapper.
///
/// ⛔ AND NOT A SIZE COMPUTED THROUGH `UIFontMetrics` INTO A `static let`. That
/// compiles, reads correctly, and is FROZEN: a `static let` is evaluated once, so
/// Larger Text would do nothing until the app was relaunched. The failure would look
/// like the feature working for whoever tested it after a restart.
///
/// ⚠️ THE ANCHOR IS NOT COSMETIC. iOS scales each text style by a different curve,
/// a caption grows proportionally more than a title, so a 12pt label anchored to
/// `.caption` reaches a different size at AX5 than the same 12pt anchored to
/// `.body`. The anchors below mirror what each token is FOR, not its raw size.
