/// The identifiers App Store Review Guideline 1.2 asks a reviewer to be shown:
/// the terms presented before sign-in, the flag on a piece of content, and the
/// block on the person who produced it.
///
/// ⛔ THEY ARE HERE BECAUSE A RECORDING HAS TO FIND THEM, NOT BECAUSE A UNIT TEST
/// DOES. Apple's request is a video made on a physical handset showing each
/// mechanism being used, and `App/UITests/ReviewRecordingTests.swift` drives that
/// walk, so every control in the 1.2 shot list needs a name that survives a copy
/// change. A control addressed by its LABEL would make the recording unrepeatable
/// the first time anybody reworded a button.
///
/// ⛔ NONE OF THESE MAY BE ADDED TO `UITestApp.forbiddenSurfaces`, AND THAT IS A
/// DECISION RATHER THAN AN OVERSIGHT. That set exists because the UI tests may run
/// signed into a LIVE production workspace, where a stray tap sends a real message or
/// releases a real number. A block is the one
/// destructive-sounding control here that is genuinely reversible, the route takes
/// the desired STATE, so an unblock puts the row back, and the whole point of the
/// recording is a test tapping it. ⚠️ What keeps that safe is the DATA rather than
/// the identifier: the demo workspace's contacts are fictional `+1 555 01xx`
/// numbers and the harness refuses to block anything else.
///
/// ⚠️ NEW STRINGS, WITH NO KOTLIN TWIN, AND THEY WILL NOT GET ONE. The Android client
/// has no blocking or reporting surface: Play's own user-generated-content policy is
/// enforced through the listing questionnaire rather than through a binary review, so
/// this is iOS-first for the same reason `district-sign-in-apple` is.
///

/// is the base and the extensions are expected rather than exceptional.
