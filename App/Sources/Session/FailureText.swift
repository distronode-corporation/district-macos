/// reads as account loss. That was learned the expensive way on the web, where an
/// unreachable region produced an empty workspace list and routed a paying customer
/// to a checkout page. Keeping the mapping in one place is what stops the next
/// screen re-deriving it and getting it wrong. Mirrors Android's `FailureText.kt`.
