/// The automation monitor: is the SDR campaign running, which workflows exist, and what

///
/// ⛔ A MONITOR, NOT A SETTINGS SECTION, AND THE DISTINCTION IS PURPOSE RATHER THAN
/// SUBJECT. Everything under the workspace-settings hub is a FORM whose save replaces
/// stored configuration, and every route behind that hub excludes `viewer` including the
/// read. Three of this screen's four routes admit viewers, nothing on it is authored, and
/// the question it answers ("did the follow-up actually go out") belongs beside Analytics
/// and HQ. Filing it under settings would have hidden it from the role most likely to be
/// asked to check.
///
/// ⚠️ TWO CONTROLS, BOTH ROLE-GATED, AND THEY ARE GATED DIFFERENTLY. Both PATCH routes
/// exclude `viewer` while every read admits one. The workflow switch is DISABLED for a
/// viewer, because the state is the content they came for and must stay visible; the
/// campaign button is ABSENT, because the card's caption already says in words who can
/// change it.
///
/// ⚠️ NO `NavigationStack` OF ITS OWN. ``ShellView`` provides one per tab and registers
/// `navigationDestination(for: Route.self)` on it exactly once.
