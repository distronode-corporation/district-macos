/// The owner mid-setup is offered the rest of the setup wizard.

/// ⛔ THE COPY NAMES NO DESTINATION, AND THAT IS `StoreCopyTests`, NOT TASTE. Guideline
/// 3.1.1 forbids steering, so no string in `Features/` may name the web, a browser, a
/// dashboard or the site. So the card says
/// what is left to do and what the button does, and the page it opens speaks for itself.
///
/// ⛔ THE BUTTON NEVER USES `openURL`. `applinks:www.distronode.com` claims
/// `/dashboard/district/*`, so asking the system to open that URL can route it straight
/// back into this app: a relaunch loop with no user input in the cycle. iOS renders the
/// page in an in-app Safari sheet; macOS has none, so the Mac names the default browser
/// (``BrowserHandOff``), as Android's `launchExternally` names a browser package.
///
/// ⚠️ ENGLISH ONLY, like the rest of both native apps, by decision.
