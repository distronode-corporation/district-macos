// The cards built from STRIPE's answer, plus the two answers that arrive on a 200 and
// are not failures.
//
// ⛔ EVERY MONEY VALUE THAT REACHES THIS FILE IS IN **CENTS** and goes through
// `BillingFormat.money(cents:)`. There is no other conversion anywhere in the screen;
// adding a second one is how two surfaces start quoting different numbers for one
// invoice.
//
// ⛔ AND NOTHING HERE IS TAPPABLE. Android's invoice row hands `hosted_invoice_url` to
// the system browser (`onOpenInvoice`) and draws an "Open" button beside it; THAT IS
// DELIBERATELY NOT PORTED. App Store Review Guideline 3.1.3(b) forbids an in-app route to
// a purchase or to subscription management, and a link out to a Stripe-hosted invoice or
// portal is exactly what turns a compliant status screen into a rejected one. The URLs
// are modelled in `BillingInvoice` only because the strict contract gate compares key
// sets and an unmodelled key would fail it, which that DTO states as well. A change that
// "restores parity" here reverses a store-compliance decision rather than fixing an
// omission.
//
// ⚠️ A REGULAR COMMENT RATHER THAN A DOC ONE: see the note at the top of
// `BillingPlanCards.swift`.

/// Every active subscription, its price, and the date it turns over.
///
/// ⛔ "renews" VERSUS "ends" IS DECIDED BY `cancel_at_period_end`, AND GETTING IT
/// BACKWARDS TELLS A CUSTOMER WHO HAS ALREADY CANCELLED THAT THEY ARE ABOUT TO BE BILLED
/// AGAIN. Same date, opposite meaning.
///
/// ⚠️ AN EMPTY LIST IS A LEGITIMATE ANSWER on a customer that exists, and it is NOT the
/// same as ``BillingUnavailableCard`` or ``BillingNoCustomerCard``, which are separate
/// states entirely. See ``BillingStripeState``.
