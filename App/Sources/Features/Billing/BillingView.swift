/// Billing: what this workspace is on, what it is using, and what has been invoiced.
///
/// ⛔ READ ONLY, AND THAT IS NOT A DECISION THIS PROJECT MAY REVISIT. App Store Review
/// Guideline 3.1.3(b) is why there is no upgrade button, no plan picker, no cancel, no
/// promo field, no card editor and ⛔ **no link out to the Stripe portal or to a hosted
/// invoice** anywhere in this file or its siblings. Android's screen does hand a hosted
/// invoice URL to a browser; that is the one place where matching Android would fail
/// review, so it is deliberately not ported. See the ⛔ at the top of
/// `BillingStripeCards.swift`.
///
/// ⛔ THE CAPTION AT THE FOOT IS LOAD BEARING RATHER THAN DECORATIVE. A plan card with no
/// controls reads as a half-built screen unless it says the change cannot be made here.
/// ⛔ AND IT NAMES NOWHERE ELSE. Guideline 3.1.1's anti-steering clause covers the
/// signpost as well as the link, so the caption states the limitation and stops.
///
/// ⛔ THE PLAN HALF AND THE STRIPE HALF HAVE SEPARATE FAILURE STATES, AND THE SPLIT IS NOT
/// COSMETIC. The plan comes from our own database and the invoices come from Stripe, so
/// the common failure is one-sided by construction, and when Stripe is the half that is
/// down the surviving half is exactly what the customer needs: the tier, the status, and
/// whether an overage cap is blocking calls right now.
///
/// ⛔ A STRIPE OUTAGE RENDERS AS "TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE" AND AN ACCOUNT WITH NO CUSTOMER
/// RENDERS AS "NO BILLING SET UP", NEVER AS EACH OTHER AND NEVER AS AN EMPTY LIST. Both
/// arrive as a 200 with the same six keys and the same empty arrays; the only difference
/// is one flag. See ``BillingStripeState``.
///
/// ⚠️ THE CARDS LIVE IN TWO SIBLING FILES, SPLIT BY DATA SOURCE, which is also the failure
/// boundary: `BillingPlanCards.swift` holds the three built from our own columns and
/// `BillingStripeCards.swift` the ones built from the vendor's answer. This file owns the
/// shell: the scroll view, the three top-level states and the read-only caption.
///
/// ⚠️ NO `NavigationStack` OF ITS OWN. ``ShellView`` provides one per tab and registers
/// `navigationDestination(for: Route.self)` on it exactly once.
