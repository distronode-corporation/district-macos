/// The Stripe half of ``BillingContent``.
///
/// ⛔ **FOUR** STATES, NOT TWO, AND THREE OF THEM ARRIVE ON A 200. `GET /api/billing`
/// answers success in every one of these cases and the last two differ on the wire by a
/// single absent key:
///
/// - ``ready(_:)``, a real customer, with subscriptions and invoices that may
///   legitimately be empty.
/// - ``noCustomer``, this account has never had a Stripe customer. Nothing failed and no
///   vendor was called.
/// - ``unavailable``, `billingUnavailable: true`. **Stripe could not be reached.**
/// - ``failed(_:)``, a genuine transport or contract failure: an unreachable origin, a
///   dead session, a shape this build cannot parse.
///
/// ⛔ COLLAPSING `noCustomer` INTO `unavailable` EITHER WAY IS THE EXPENSIVE MISTAKE. One
/// direction tells a subscribed customer they have no plan during a vendor outage; the
/// other tells an unstarted account that billing is broken. It is the same "we could not
/// look" against "there is nothing" conflation that can send a paying customer to a
/// checkout page, except about their PLAN.
///
/// ⚠️ A DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE FROM ANDROID, WHICH HAS THREE. There `noCustomer` renders
/// as `Ready` with empty lists and the words "No subscription is attached to this
/// account", because its DTO cannot tell the two apart from the arrays alone. This
/// client's ``StripeBilling/availability`` decides it once, in the model layer, so a card
/// cannot forget to.

///
/// 1. Without a tier and a status there is no headline for this screen. An invoice list
///    under no plan is a receipt drawer, not a billing page.
/// 2. The Stripe read **cannot be relied on to report a failure at all.** Its outage
///    shape is a 200 carrying `billingUnavailable`, so an "only fail when both fail" rule
///    would keep a screen alive on a plan read that genuinely failed, beside a Stripe
///    section that was merely unavailable, with nothing true on it.

/// payment method, and no URL handed out for a browser to open. `POST /api/billing` does
/// all of that and is not modelled anywhere in this client; App Store Review Guideline
/// 3.1.3(b) is why, and it is not a product preference. See ``BillingRepository``.
///
/// ⛔ THE TWO READS RUN CONCURRENTLY, AND HERE THAT IS AVAILABILITY RATHER THAN LATENCY.
/// The plan comes from OUR OWN columns and reaches no vendor; the Stripe read is only as
/// available as Stripe is. In the obvious sequential shape a failing Stripe call would
/// stop the plan read being ISSUED at all, and the plan read is precisely the one that
/// works when Stripe does not: the tier, the status, and whether an overage cap is
/// blocking calls right now. `async let` makes "either half can be late or absent without
/// touching the other" structural rather than something each branch has to remember.
///
/// ⛔ AND BOTH LAND BEFORE CONTENT IS PUBLISHED, for the reason ``AnalyticsModel``

/// beside a populated plan card and read the emptiness as "no invoices" rather than as
