/// ⛔ NO URL, NO LINK AND NO CALL TO ACTION POINTING AT A PURCHASE, and the absence is
/// the point. See the ⛔ on ``MarketplaceView`` for why; ``readOnly`` states the boundary
/// and names nowhere, exactly as ``BillingCopy/readOnly`` does. `StoreCopyTests` holds
/// that line.
///
/// ⚠️ ITS OWN FILE RATHER THAN AN EXTENSION AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, the same
/// call ``DialerCopy`` and ``WorkflowsCopy`` make: `swiftlint --strict` promotes the
/// `file_length` WARNING at 500 lines to an error, and the view already carries two
/// tabs' worth of states.
///
/// ⛔ THE COPY IS ANDROID'S, and the Android client's string resources carry the same
/// wording. Four of them are load bearing rather than decorative:
/// "No matches" rather than an error, "No carrier connected" rather than a failure,
/// "Managed by Distronode" rather than a row that looks like the tenant's own, and the
/// read-only caption stating the boundary rather than linking or naming one.
///
/// ⚠️ ONE STRING IS DELIBERATELY NOT BYTE-IDENTICAL TO ANDROID'S. Its
/// `marketplace_read_only` joins the two halves of the sentence with an em-dash;
/// this client's copy uses commas, periods or parentheses instead, so the dash is a
/// comma here. Nothing else about the wording differs.
