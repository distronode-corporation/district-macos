import SwiftUI

// The confirmations, the shared notice strip, and nothing else.
//
// ⛔ EVERY IRREVERSIBLE OR BILLABLE WRITE ON THESE SURFACES IS COMMITTED FROM HERE AND
// NOWHERE ELSE. A release takes a live line out of service; a submit files a regulated
// application in the customer's name; A2P and toll-free verification each pay a carrier fee
// and enter a review a repeat cannot undo; a lookup costs money per tap. ⚠️ Reapplying a
// number's routing is deliberately NOT confirmed: it is idempotent and converges, and a
// confirmation on it would train the operator to dismiss the ones that matter.
//
// ⛔ AND A FAILED IRREVERSIBLE WRITE DOES NOT HAND ITS BUTTON BACK. A dialog cleared only
// on success, gated only on "not running", would re-enable a destructive button live,
// directly under its own failure sentence. So the submit is gated on
// ``NumberWriteState/isArmed``, which answers false
// while a write is in flight AND after a failure that cannot prove the write did not land;
// the model re-checks the same thing, because a disabled button is not something anything
// else can make a claim about.
//
// ⚠️ EACH CONFIRMATION NAMES WHAT HAPPENS IN THE UNITS THE OPERATOR THINKS IN rather than
// asking "are you sure". "This cannot be undone" tells nobody what they are weighing; "your
// callers reach nothing" does.
//
// ⚠️ A `//` HEADER RATHER THAN A `///` ONE: SwiftFormat's `docComments` rule rejects a doc
// comment attached to no declaration.

/// Draws whichever confirmation is open, and nothing when none is.
///
/// ⛔ AN EXHAUSTIVE SWITCH WITH NO `default`, so a case added to ``NumberConfirmation`` and
/// forgotten here fails the build rather than producing a screen where the model believes a
/// confirmation is open and the operator sees nothing.
