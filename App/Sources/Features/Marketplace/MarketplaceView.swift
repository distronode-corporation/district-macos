/// The phone-number surface: what the workspace has, what a carrier has for sale, the
/// regulatory paperwork, and the carrier account underneath it all.
///
/// ⛔ RELEASING AND RECONFIGURING ARE HERE, on the ``MarketplaceTab/carrier`` and
/// per-number surfaces, behind confirmations that name the consequence.
///
/// ⛔ **BUYING IS ABSENT.** A purchase charges a setup fee AND opens a recurring monthly
/// charge for a service consumed inside the app, which is App Store Review Guideline
/// **3.1.1**: an in-app purchase or it is not offered at all. There is no control, no
/// ``EndpointID`` case, no ``DistrictPaths`` constant and no repository method, and
/// ``ApiRequestDescriptor``'s initialiser is internal, so the route is unconstructible
/// rather than merely undrawn. `NumberSurfaceTests` asserts that against the whole
/// expressible surface.
///
/// ⛔ NOTHING ON THIS SCREEN LEAVES IT, AND GUIDELINE 3.1.3(b) DOES NOT LICENSE A LINK OUT.
/// 3.1.3(b) is the MULTIPLATFORM SERVICES exception: it lets an app that runs on more than
/// one platform give a user ACCESS to content, subscriptions and features they acquired
/// elsewhere. It licenses nothing about pointing at the place they acquire them. 3.1.3's
/// own terms are the other half and they are a prohibition rather than a permission: an
/// app in that section may not use buttons, external links or other calls to action
/// directing customers to a purchasing mechanism other than in-app purchase.
/// ⛔ 3.1.1 CARRIES THE SAME PROHIBITION ON STEERING, AND PROSE IS NOT THE SAFE HALF.
/// Its anti-steering clause forbids the SIGNPOST, so ``MarketplaceCopy/purchaseElsewhere``
/// and every other sentence in the app names no destination. `StoreCopyTests` is the
/// gate that keeps it out.
///
/// ⛔ SO NOTHING IS NAMED AND NOTHING IS LINKED, WHICH IS TRUE OF THE WHOLE APP.
/// ``ShellView/lapsed(inactiveCount:)`` states the subscription is not active and stops;
/// ``BillingCopy/readOnly`` says the change is not available in this app; ``SchedulingCopy``'s
/// `notEligible` states the refusal and offers nothing; ``MarketplaceCopy/readOnly`` is
/// this screen's sentence. ``ShellView``'s own browser hand-off is a different thing: it
/// hands BACK a claimed URL the app cannot draw rather than pointing at a purchase.
///
/// ⛔ THE TWO MARKETPLACE READS STILL ADMIT `viewer` AND ARE NOT ROLE-GATED; THE PROVISIONING
/// TABS ARE A DIFFERENT ANSWER. Ten of the sixteen provisioning routes exclude `viewer`
/// server-side, so those controls are withheld and the viewer is told who can, a viewer must
/// not see a dead control, and must not be walked into a 403 on entry either. On the two READ
/// tabs the role still decides only the caption's wording. See the ⚠️ on
/// ``Route/marketplace(workspaceId:role:)`` and ``MarketplaceModel/canChangeNumbers``.
///
/// ⚠️ THE ROWS AND THE FORM LIVE IN `MarketplaceCards.swift`, the provisioning surfaces in
/// `RegistrationsSection.swift`, `CarrierSection.swift`, `ComplianceSection.swift` and
/// `NumberActionsSheet.swift`. This file owns the shell: the four segments, the dispatch into
/// each tab, the two sheets and the caption. Same split ``AnalyticsView`` uses, and for the
/// same `file_length` ceiling.
///
/// ⚠️ NO `NavigationStack` OF ITS OWN. ``ShellView`` provides one per tab and
/// registers `navigationDestination(for: Route.self)` on it exactly once. ⛔ Which is also why
/// the per-number actions are a SHEET rather than a route: a destination holding an
/// irreversible release would be restored from a `NavigationPath` after process death
/// against a number that may no longer exist.
