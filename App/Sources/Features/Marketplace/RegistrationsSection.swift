//
// ⛔ NO PURCHASE CONTROL AND NO LINK TO ONE, exactly as the marketplace tabs have none. A
// registration exists to make a purchase POSSIBLE; the purchase itself is App Store Review
// Guideline 3.1.1 territory, and ``MarketplaceCopy/purchaseElsewhere`` says only that it
// cannot be done in this app. ⚠️ It names no destination: 3.1.1 forbids the signpost as
// well as the tap.
//
// ⛔ THE WORD "DRAFT" IS LOAD-BEARING. A created filing has reached no carrier at all, so a
// row must not read as "submitted", that is the word a customer would then use back at us
// about something that has not been filed.
//
// ⚠️ A `//` HEADER RATHER THAN A `///` ONE: SwiftFormat's `docComments` rule rejects a doc
// comment attached to no declaration.
