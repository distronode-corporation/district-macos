// smallest set of fields its route actually reads. A field the route ignores would be a
// control that changes nothing, which is worse than its absence because the operator would
// believe they had set something, the reason ``NumberSearchForm`` has no page size.

// ⚠️ THEY LIVE ON THE MODEL RATHER THAN IN A VIEW so they survive a tab switch, which is the
// one thing on this screen that replaces a form's content wholesale.

/// answers. A form built from anything else asks a customer for papers they do not have and
/// omits the ones they do.
