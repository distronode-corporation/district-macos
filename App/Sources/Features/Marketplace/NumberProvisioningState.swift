// The provisioning surfaces' state: what each read is doing, what each write is doing, and
// the one derived type the lookup's answer is rendered from.
//
// ⛔ EVERY WRITE ON THESE SURFACES CARRIES ITS OWN STATE RATHER THAN SHARING ONE. Five of
// them are on screen at once (a filing's submit, a document's removal, a number's release,
// a Verify toggle, a lookup) and they fail for unrelated reasons; one shared `mutation`
// would disarm four controls because the fifth failed, and would show the wrong sentence
// under whichever one the operator was looking at.
//
// ⛔ AND A FAILED IRREVERSIBLE WRITE MUST NOT SILENTLY RE-ARM. A control gated only on "not
// running" hands a destructive button straight back, live, under its own failure sentence.
// The rule is enforced here through ``NumberWriteState/isArmed``, which reads its answer off
// ``NumberWriteResubmit`` rather than off "not currently running".
//
// ⚠️ A `//` HEADER RATHER THAN A `///` ONE: SwiftFormat's `docComments` rule rejects a doc
// comment attached to no declaration.

/// What one write is doing, and whether its control may be pressed again.
///
/// ⛔ THE `.failed` CASE CARRIES ITS OWN RESUBMIT VERDICT, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. A
/// failure that PROVES the write did not land (a 4xx: the role guard, the ownership check,
/// the rate limiter, a malformed body) re-arms the control; a 5xx, a transport failure and a
/// decode failure do not, because none of them proves anything and the last one actively
/// proves the write DID land (it is only ever produced from a 2xx). See
/// ``NumberWriteResubmit``, which states the rule on the tested tier.
