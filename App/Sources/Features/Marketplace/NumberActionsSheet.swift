// One number's own actions, and the billable lookup.
//
// ⛔ THE TWO CONTROLS HERE ARE NOT PEERS. Reapplying routing is idempotent and converges, so
// it commits on a tap; releasing takes a live line out of service and generally cannot be
// reclaimed, so it goes through a confirmation that says the callers reach NOTHING. Giving
// them the same weight would be the more dangerous error: a confirmation on the harmless one
// trains the operator to dismiss the one that matters.
//
// ⛔ AND A MANAGED NUMBER OFFERS NEITHER. `managed: true` means the line is held on
// Distronode's carrier account, so it is the tenant's to USE and not to administer, and the
// caption says why rather than leaving a missing button to be read as a bug.
//
// ⛔ THE LOOKUP IS BILLABLE PER TAP AND IS THE MOST INNOCUOUS-LOOKING CONTROL ON THE SCREEN,
// which is exactly why it is confirmed at all. It must never fire on a keystroke, on appear or
// in a retry loop.
//
// ⚠️ A `//` HEADER RATHER THAN A `///` ONE: SwiftFormat's `docComments` rule rejects a doc
// comment attached to no declaration.

/// What can be done to one number the workspace holds.
