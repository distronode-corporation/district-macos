/// more deliberate act, and opening on an empty search form would make the screen
/// look like it had nothing in it.
///
/// ⛔ FOUR TABS, AND TWO OF THEM ARE NOT SEARCH RESULTS. `registrations` is the
/// regulatory paperwork that has to exist before a number in some countries can be bought;
/// `carrier` is the account the number lives on, plus the compliance filings and the billable
/// lookup. Both are role-gated where the marketplace's two reads are not, so the tab is
/// present for a viewer and its controls are not, ⛔ a viewer must not see a dead control.
///

/// recurring monthly charge for a service consumed inside the app, which is App Store Review
/// Guideline 3.1.1: an in-app purchase or nothing. ⛔ 3.1.1 covers steering too, so there is
/// no link either, ``MarketplaceCopy/purchaseElsewhere`` states the boundary in prose,
/// names no destination and offers nothing to tap.
///
/// ⛔ DECLARED AT FILE SCOPE RATHER THAN NESTED, like every type in
/// `WorkflowsModel.swift` and for the reason `AnalyticsModel.swift` records: a
/// nested type whose name matches an associated-type requirement of a protocol the
/// enclosing type conforms to becomes the WITNESS for it, and the error surfaces

/// `purchasing` flag here or anywhere is App Store Review Guideline 3.1.1 and has to be
/// discussed.
///

/// URL held on this model is a link waiting for a button; the screen states in prose that
/// numbers are not bought here and offers nothing to tap. See the ⛔ on ``MarketplaceView``.
///
/// ⛔ TWO INDEPENDENT READS THAT NEVER SHARE A FAILURE. "What can I buy" and "what do
/// I have" hit different routes with different data layers, so a single failure state
/// would blank an answer the client already holds. Each half carries its own, the
/// same call ``WorkflowsModel`` and ``AnalyticsModel`` make.
///
/// ⛔ THE OWNED LIST LOADS ON ENTRY AND THE SEARCH DOES NOT. Listing what the
/// workspace has is why the screen exists and costs one request; a search is a
/// carrier inventory query against filters only the operator can supply, so firing
/// one on open would spend a request to answer a question nobody asked, and would
/// fill the tab with US local numbers regardless of where the workspace operates.
/// ⛔ THE SAME RULE GOVERNS THE TWO PROVISIONING TABS, and it is sharper there: the filing list
/// refreshes every in-review bundle FROM THE CARRIER on read, and the lookup is billed per
/// call. Each provisioning read fires when its tab is opened, and the lookup only on a tap.
///
/// ⚠️ THE FORM LIVES HERE RATHER THAN IN THE VIEW so it survives a tab switch, which
/// is the one thing on this screen that replaces the search half's content.
