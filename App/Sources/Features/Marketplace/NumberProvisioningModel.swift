/// The phone-number provisioning surfaces: carrier connectivity, the regulatory filings,
/// the carrier-account setup, and the three things that can be done to a number the
/// workspace already holds.
///
/// ⛔ THERE IS NO PURCHASE HERE AND THERE MUST NOT BE. Buying a number charges a setup fee
/// AND opens a recurring monthly charge for a service consumed inside the app, which is App
/// Store Review Guideline 3.1.1: an in-app purchase or nothing. ``NumbersRepository`` has no
/// purchase method to call, `EndpointID` has no case for it, and
/// ``ApiRequestDescriptor``'s initialiser is internal, so it is unconstructible rather than
/// merely absent. ⛔ 3.1.1 covers STEERING too, so there is no URL here either: if a
/// `webURL`, an `openWeb` or a "Buy on the dashboard" action ever appears in this file, the
/// decision recorded on ``MarketplaceView`` has been reversed and should have been
/// discussed.
///
/// ⛔ FIVE INDEPENDENT READS AND SEVEN INDEPENDENT WRITES, NONE OF WHICH SHARE A STATE. The
/// reads hit different routes with different failure modes, so one shared failure would
/// blank answers the client already holds, the same call ``MarketplaceModel`` makes for its
/// two halves and ``AnalyticsModel`` for its two. The writes each carry a
/// ``NumberWriteState`` because five of them can be on screen at once and they fail for
/// unrelated reasons.
///
/// ⛔ AND A FAILED IRREVERSIBLE WRITE DOES NOT RE-ARM ITS CONTROL. A destructive button
/// handed back live under its own failure sentence invites a second irreversible write, so
/// the rule here is enforced by ``NumberWriteState/isArmed`` reading ``NumberWriteResubmit``, and by
/// ``confirmation`` being CLEARED only on the paths where the outcome is known.
///
/// ⛔ NOTHING LOADS ON ENTRY EXCEPT WHAT THE OPEN TAB NEEDS, and the filing list is
/// deliberately not free: the route refreshes every in-review bundle from the carrier on
/// read, so a screen that reloaded it on every appearance would spend a customer's own
/// carrier calls. ⛔ The lookup fires on ONE TAP ONLY, never on a keystroke, on appear or in
/// a retry loop, because the carrier bills per request.
///
/// ⚠️ A VIEWER MAY READ `provider/status`, `numbers/requirements`, `workspace/sip` and
/// `workspace/verify` and NOTHING ELSE on this surface. So the two role-gated reads are not
/// even attempted for one, and no write control is drawn, a viewer must not see a dead
/// control. ⚠️ The role is an affordance rather than a security control and errs low: a nil
/// role means "could not be established", never "assume client".
