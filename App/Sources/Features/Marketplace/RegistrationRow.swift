// One regulatory filing: its status, what the carrier objected to, its documents, and the
// one control that files it.
//
// ⛔ THE SUBMIT IS OFFERED ONLY ON A DRAFT, because every other status means the filing is
// already with the carrier and the route answers **409** rather than 403, the request is
// well-formed and will be valid again if the review comes back rejected. Drawing a live
// button that can only 409 reads as a broken screen.
//
// ⛔ AND DOCUMENTS MAY ONLY BE REMOVED FROM A DRAFT, for the same reason plus a sharper one:
// once a filing has been submitted the carrier and the regulator hold a copy of exactly the
// documents that were sent, so swapping one out on our side would leave our record
// disagreeing with the filing under review and the customer believing they had corrected
// something they had not.
//
// ⚠️ THERE IS NO UPLOAD CONTROL HERE. The repository can upload
// (``NumbersRepository/uploadRegistrationDocument(workspaceId:bundleId:requirementName:fileName:mimeType:bytes:)``,
// covered by the package tests) but choosing a file needs a document picker, and a picker is a
// platform surface with its own permissions, its own cancellation and its own 10 MiB and
// sniffed-mime refusals to render. That is a screen rather than a button, and it is
// deliberately left out of this row; the removal is here because it needs no picker at all.
//
// ⚠️ A `//` HEADER RATHER THAN A `///` ONE: SwiftFormat's `docComments` rule rejects a doc
// comment attached to no declaration.
