// Every sentence the phone-number PROVISIONING surfaces say: the regulatory filings, the
// carrier accounts, and the three things that can be done to a number the workspace holds.
//
// ⛔ NO URL, NO LINK AND NO CALL TO ACTION POINTING AT A PURCHASE, AND THE ABSENCE IS THE
// POINT, the same rule `MarketplaceCopy` already keeps, for a rule that is one guideline
// over. Buying a number charges a setup fee AND opens a recurring monthly charge for a
// service consumed inside the app, which is App Store Review Guideline 3.1.1: an in-app
// purchase or nothing. ⛔ 3.1.1 covers STEERING too, and prose counts: naming the
// destination IS the steering, not only offering a tap. Every sentence here says what
// cannot be done in this app and names nowhere, and `StoreCopyTests` fails the build if
// one names a place. Do not add a `webURL`, a Safari sheet or a "Buy" caption pointing
// outward either; see the ⛔ at the top of `MarketplaceView.swift`.
//
// ⚠️ ITS OWN FILE RATHER THAN MORE OF `MarketplaceCopy.swift`, the same call `DialerCopy`
// and `WorkflowsCopy` make: `swiftlint --strict` promotes `file_length` at 500 lines to an
// error, and that file already carries the marketplace's two tabs' worth of states.
//
// ⛔ THREE SENTENCES HERE ARE LOAD-BEARING RATHER THAN DECORATIVE, and each one exists
// because the alternative misleads:
//   - ``releaseConfirmBody`` says the callers reach NOTHING, because "this cannot be
//     undone" tells nobody what they are weighing.
//   - ``lookupConfirmBody`` says it COSTS MONEY, because a lookup looks free and is not.
//   - ``writeUnrepeatable`` explains why a control is gone, because a dead button with no
//     explanation reads as a broken screen.
//
// ⚠️ A `//` HEADER RATHER THAN A `///` ONE: SwiftFormat's `docComments` rule rejects a doc
// comment attached to no declaration.
