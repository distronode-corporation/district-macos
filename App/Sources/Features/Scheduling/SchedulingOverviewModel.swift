/// ⛔ FIVE SEPARATE STATES RATHER THAN ONE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE SHAPE OF THIS MODEL.
/// The web renders each row's own failure in red and leaves the others standing, because
/// the reads are genuinely independent: a calendar outage says nothing about whether the
/// event types loaded. One combined state would blank a screen that is four-fifths
/// correct, which on a register whose job is "is my booking desk set up" is the answer
/// most likely to send somebody looking for a problem that is not there.
///
/// ⛔ AND THE READS RUN CONCURRENTLY, ONCE PER SCREEN VISIT. They are five GETs against
/// one route; issuing them in series would make the slowest one the screen's latency, and
/// re-issuing them on every redraw is what `State(initialValue:)` in the view's `init`
/// exists to prevent. ⚠️ Reads are unlimited on this surface (only writes spend the
/// workspace's 120-per-hour budget, see ``SchedulingAdminOp/isWrite``) but "unlimited" is
/// not a licence to poll: nothing here loops.
///
/// ⚠️ THE TIMEZONE IS READ AND IS NOT THE DEVICE'S. Every stamp on this screen is
/// rendered in the timezone on the operator's SCHEDULER profile (`me.get`), because that
/// is the zone the customer was told. A booking read on a phone in another country must
/// still say the hour the customer expects. ⛔ A failed `me.get` does NOT fail the screen:
/// it falls back to UTC and the header says which zone it is using, which is the honest
/// degradation, the alternative is five correct rows hidden behind one optional field.
