/// ⛔ THREE READS, AND TWO OF THEM CAN BE REFUSED FOR A REASON THAT IS NOT A FAULT. Notes
/// and transcripts live behind recording storage, which is not enabled in every region;
/// that refusal arrives as a **424** and means "this region does not store recordings",
/// not "something broke". ``SchedulingCopy/mediaUnavailable`` is what says so, and the
/// generic sentence would send an operator hunting for an outage.
///
/// ⚠️ THE 424 CANNOT BE SEEN FROM `SchedulingAdminError`, WHICH HAS NO STATUS. It arrives
/// as ``SchedulingAdminFailureCode/unknown``, so the screen cannot distinguish it from a
/// genuine contract failure and says the softer of the two sentences for both. That is a
/// deliberate trade recorded rather than hidden: on a surface where storage-off is the
/// common case and a shape mismatch is the rare one, naming the common cause is the more
/// useful wrong answer, and neither offers a retry.
