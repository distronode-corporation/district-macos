/// The public booking page's look: seven fields, a logo and a banner.
///
/// ⛔ THE PATCH IS A REPLACEMENT, NOT A SPARSE PATCH, AND THAT IS WHY THIS MODEL
/// REFUSES TO EXIST WITHOUT A LOADED ``SchedulingBranding``. The fork decodes into
/// non-pointer fields, so an omitted `privacy_url` CLEARS the customer's privacy
/// link; the catalog makes all seven required precisely so that cannot happen by
/// accident, and ``SchedulingBrandingUpdate/init(from:)`` makes "send back what you
/// read" the only thing that compiles. A form seeded from nothing does not save
/// nothing, it deletes two legal links and a business name.
///
/// ⛔ AND THE TWO IMAGE URLs ARE NOT PART OF IT. `logo_url` and `banner_url` are
/// read-only on the patch: they are set by the multipart upload and cleared by
/// their own delete ops, so an empty string sent for either is a 400 naming a
/// field that does not exist rather than a clear.
///
/// ⚠️ THESE UPLOADS ARE `client`-LEVEL AND SPEND THE WORKSPACE'S 120-an-hour
/// bucket, unlike the avatar on ``SchedulingProfileModel``, which is `viewer` and
/// spends the member's 30. They are separate budgets on purpose.
