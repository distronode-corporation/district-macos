/// screen holds the row being asked about, and each row's button carries a dialog
/// that presents only while that row is the pending one. So a revoke/delete button
/// here calls `ask(_:)` on a model the screen owns, while a create owns its own.
///
/// ⛔ AND NOTHING HERE EVER HOLDS THE SECRET. `apiKeys.create` and
/// `webhooks.create` each answer a credential exactly once and the sheet that
/// presents it drops it on dismissal (see ``SchedulingAPIKeyCreateModel`` and
/// ``SchedulingWebhookEditorModel``); these buttons carry the model in and read
/// nothing back out.
