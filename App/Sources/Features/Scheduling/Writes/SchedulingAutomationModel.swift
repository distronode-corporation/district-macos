/// Recording storage, the notetaker and the booking assistant: three ops behind
/// one Save.
///
/// ⛔ ONLY THE CHANGED SECTIONS ARE SENT, WHICH IS THE WEB RECORDINGS TAB'S
/// OWN BEHAVIOUR AND NOT AN OPTIMISATION. Each of the three is a separate write
/// against the workspace's 120-an-hour budget, and `settings.llm.patch` with
/// neither field is a VALID no-op, the schema marks both optional, so a client
/// that always sent all three would spend three writes to change one toggle and
/// the server would not object. Deciding not to send is the only place that can be
/// decided.
///
/// ⛔ TURNING RECORDING ON DOES NOT MAKE RECORDING WORK. An instance with no object
/// storage records meetings that then have nowhere to upload to, and nothing about
/// this call's success says which case a workspace is in,
/// ``SchedulingStorageSettings/recordingsStorageReady`` does. The toggle is
/// disabled while that is anything but `true`, and the hint says why.
///
/// ⛔ AND BOTH THE NOTETAKER AND THE ASSISTANT SCHEMAS ARE `z.strictObject`.
/// Anything else in either body, `stt_api_key` above all, is a **400 naming the
/// field**, which is the intended behaviour: silently accepting a credential a
/// customer believes they set is the worse of the two failures. That is why there
/// is no key field on this form and must not be one.
