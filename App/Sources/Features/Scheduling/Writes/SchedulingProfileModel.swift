/// The signed-in member's own scheduler profile, and their picture.
///
/// ⛔ FIVE FIELDS, AND THE FORM OWNS ALL FIVE. `me.patch` is sparse, an absent key
/// is left alone, but the web profile tab sends every one of them on every
/// save because the form holds every one of them. Sending only what was touched
/// would be correct on the wire and wrong in the product: a stale draft beside a
/// value somebody else changed is two answers to one question, and nothing here
/// re-reads between opening the sheet and saving.
///
/// ⛔ THE WIRE FIELD IS `timezone` AND THE COLUMN IS `iana_timezone`. Sending the
/// column name is SILENTLY IGNORED, which leaves every window this member
/// publishes on whatever zone the SSO hand-off inserted. ``SchedulingMeUpdate``
/// spells it correctly; this note is here because the mistake is invisible.
///
/// ⚠️ `me.*` WRITES SPEND THE **MEMBER** BUDGET, 30 an hour, not the workspace's
/// 120. A screen that saved on every keystroke would lock one person out for an
/// hour without touching anyone else, which is why this saves on a button.
///
/// ⚠️ THE AVATAR IS `viewer`-LEVEL AND THE BRANDING IMAGES ARE NOT. A shared
/// bucket would let one person uploading their own picture lock every administrator
/// out of every write for an hour; the two targets deliberately do not share one,
/// and this model owns only the `viewer` one.
