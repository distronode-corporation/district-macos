/// ⚠️ THE OP IS ADMIN-ONLY AT THE FAR END AND THE ROLE THAT DECIDES IT IS THE
/// SCHEDULER'S, NOT DISTRONODE'S. The web gates this control on the signed-in
/// scheduler profile's `is_admin` rather than on District's own `canManage`,
/// because the fork's handler answers 403 "admin access required". The caller owns
/// that gate; this model does not re-derive it, and a refusal still arrives as
/// ``SchedulingAdminError/forbidden`` with an honest sentence.
