/// The weekly working-hours editor: read the rules, edit a week, save the
/// difference.
///
/// ⛔ THE SAVE IS A DIFF, NOT A REPLACE, AND THERE IS NO OP THAT WOULD LET IT BE A
/// REPLACE. `availability.rules.*` is create/patch/delete per row, there is no
/// "put the week", so a screen that wanted to be simple would have to delete
/// seven days of rules and recreate them, which is two writes per window for a
/// save that changed one, and leaves the tenancy with NO working hours at all for
/// as long as the middle of that sequence takes.
///
/// ⛔ THE THREE PHASES RUN IN ORDER AND STOP AT THE FIRST REFUSAL, which means a
/// partial save is a real outcome and is reported as one. It is still the right
/// arrangement: the alternative is issuing the creates anyway, into a week whose
/// deletes did not happen, where every one of them overlaps something.
/// ⚠️ The re-read runs either way, so what is on screen afterwards is what the
/// fork holds rather than what this client hoped.
///
/// ⚠️ `event_type_id` IS NOT PATCHABLE, so nothing here offers to move a window
/// between event types. The schema takes the day and the two times and nothing
/// else; a control for it would be a 400 on a field the server never reads.
