/// reassign or cancel, then archive. `users.upcomingBookings` is the read that
/// makes the first step possible, which is why it belongs beside the archive and
/// not with the bookings namespace. ``canArchive`` is false while the read is in
/// flight for the same reason the web's is, offering the button before the answer
/// is offering a refusal.
///
/// ⛔ AND A REFUSAL CANNOT BE EXPLAINED SPECIFICALLY FROM THIS SIDE. The fork's
/// four 4xx answers (409 still hosting, 403 not the owner, 400 owner or already
/// archived, 404 gone) are all collapsed to ``SchedulingAdminError/unknown`` by
/// `error(forStatus:code:)` before a screen sees them, so
/// ``SchedulingTeamWriteCopy/archiveRefused`` enumerates instead of asserting.
///
/// ⚠️ SOFT, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT SAFE TO OFFER AT ALL. The row and its links
/// survive; the member cannot sign in, is skipped in routing and their event types
/// are deactivated. The copy says so rather than saying "delete".
