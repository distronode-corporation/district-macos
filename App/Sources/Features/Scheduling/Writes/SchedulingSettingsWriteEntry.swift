/// ⛔ EACH BUTTON TAKES THE VALUE ITS TAB READ, AND THAT IS WHAT KEEPS A FORM OFF A
/// FAILED READ. `settings.branding.patch` and `me.patch` both send every field they
/// were given, so a form rendered from nothing and then saved does not save nothing
/// , it blanks a customer-facing page or a host's timezone. The read screen renders
/// these only from `.ready`, which is why the payload is a parameter rather than
/// something the model fetches for itself.
///
/// ⛔ AND THE ROLE RULE DIFFERS BETWEEN THEM, WHICH IS THE TRAP ON THIS SCREEN.
/// Branding and the recording settings are `client`-level; `me.patch` and
/// `me.avatar.delete` are `viewer`-level, because they touch only the caller's OWN
/// profile, a viewer who cannot set their own timezone is offered every booking
/// window in the wrong hours. The gate is therefore applied by the SCREEN, per tab,
/// and never by this file.
