/// The seven `notify_*` preferences, which are the same `me.patch` op as the
/// profile and a separate form.
///
/// ⛔ A SEPARATE MODEL FROM ``SchedulingProfileModel`` THOUGH IT IS ONE OP, WHICH
/// IS THE WEB NOTIFICATIONS TAB'S OWN SPLIT. `me.patch` is sparse, so each
/// form sends only the keys it owns and the other form's fields are left alone,
/// which is what makes two forms over one op safe. ⛔ Merging them would mean one
/// save carrying twelve fields, and a stale draft in either half would overwrite
/// whatever the other half had just stored.
///
/// ⚠️ `notifyHostCancel` AND `notifyCancellation` ARE ONE WORD APART AND MEAN MAIL
/// TO TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE, the host, and the attendee. That is why
/// ``SchedulingMeUpdate`` is a struct of labelled properties rather than twelve
/// positional optionals, and why the two groups are labelled on screen.
