/// use for; copying across only the two fields it renders is what stops a later
/// edit deciding to keep the whole response around "for the list".

/// the last minted key would leave a live credential in memory for as long as the
/// screen stayed up. There is no re-read: `apiKeys.list` never carries a secret,
/// so a key lost here is a key that has to be revoked and re-minted.
///
/// ⛔ AND NOTHING HERE WRITES IT ANYWHERE. No `UserDefaults`, no keychain, no log
/// line, and `failure` is built from the refusal's CODE rather than from anything
/// that was sent, so no path out of this type can carry the plaintext with it.
///
/// ⚠️ `busy` GATES THE SUBMIT BECAUSE A SECOND PRESS MINTS A SECOND CREDENTIAL, of
