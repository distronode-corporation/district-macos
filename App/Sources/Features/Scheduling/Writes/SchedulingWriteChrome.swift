///
/// ⛔ A SUCCESS CARRIES A SENTENCE RATHER THAN BEING A BARE `saved`, BECAUSE SOME OF
/// THESE WRITES DO NOT HAVE ONE FIXED OUTCOME. The reschedule names the new time
/// because "Booking moved" alone does not let an operator check they moved it
/// to the day they meant. The web flashes exactly these strings and they are ported
/// rather than re-invented.
///
/// ⚠️ NO `savedButStale`, WHICH IS THE DIFFERENCE FROM ``SettingsSaveState`` AND IS A
/// PROPERTY OF THE ROUTE RATHER THAN A SIMPLIFICATION. Every workspace-settings write
/// answers `{"success": true}` and has to be re-read; every scheduling-admin write here
/// either ECHOES the row it wrote or answers nothing and hands the re-read to the screen
/// that owns the list, so a fifth case would be a state no code path could reach.
///

/// refused save that also discarded what somebody typed is two losses for one fault.
