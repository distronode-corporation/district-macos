/// ⛔ THE SAVE IS TWO OPS IN A FIXED ORDER, HOSTS FIRST, AND THE ORDER IS THE
/// WEB'S. `eventTypes.hosts.put` REPLACES the list and the schema refuses an empty
/// array; `eventTypes.patch` then carries `routing_mode` and `rr_strategy`, which
/// are columns on the event type rather than on a host. Patching first would leave
/// a `round_robin` event type pointing at a host list that had not arrived, which
/// is a bookable state nobody chose.
///
/// ⛔ THE REFUSAL FOR AN EMPTY LIST IS ON THE SAVE, NOT ON THE REMOVE, AND THAT IS
/// DELIBERATE RATHER THAN LAX. Swapping the only host for a different one means
/// passing through zero rows; a Remove button that refused the last row would make
/// that ordinary edit impossible, and the schema's `.min(1)` is enforced at the
/// wire either way.
///
/// ⚠️ THERE IS NO DRAG ORDERING, ON EITHER CLIENT. The table renders in
/// `eventTypes.hosts.get` order and `priority` is the only ordering signal the
/// fork reads, and it reads it only under `rr_strategy == "priority"`.
