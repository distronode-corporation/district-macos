/// The four things that can be done TO an event type rather than IN it: turn it
/// on or off, archive or restore it, send yourself one of its emails, delete it.
///
/// ⛔ SEPARATE FROM ``SchedulingEventTypeEditorModel`` BECAUSE NONE OF THEM READS
/// THE FORM, AND THE TEST EMAIL PROVES WHY THAT MATTERS. `eventTypes.testEmail`
/// sends the STORED wording, so offering it beside unsaved edits invites somebody
/// to check a template they have just changed and be shown the old one. The web
/// disables the button while the tab is dirty for exactly this reason; a model
/// that holds no draft cannot be dirty at all.
///
/// ⛔ ARCHIVE AND DELETE ARE DIFFERENT OPERATIONS AND BOTH ARE OFFERED. Archiving
/// is `eventTypes.patch {archived: true}` and hides the event type while its
/// bookings stay addressable; `eventTypes.delete` removes the row and its booking
/// page. Only the delete confirms, which is the web's arrangement and is right:
/// archiving is reversible from the same menu.
///
/// ⚠️ THE ROW IS HELD AND REPLACED ON EVERY PATCH, so the menu's labels ("Turn
/// off" versus "Turn on") come from what the server last said rather than from
/// what this client assumed it did.
