/// SVG renamed `.png` and declared `image/png` still fails there. What checking
/// here buys is a sentence the app can word itself, one round trip earlier, never
/// a guarantee.

/// ⛔ AND THE THREE ANSWERS ARE KEPT APART. "Too large", "not a type we can use"

/// collapsing them leaves an operator re-picking the same file. The upload route
/// itself answers 413 and 415 for the first two, and both land on

/// type" arm, which is exactly why the mitigation belongs on the way IN.
