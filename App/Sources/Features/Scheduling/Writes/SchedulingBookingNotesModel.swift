/// Asking for a booking's meeting notes to be written again.
///
/// ⛔ IT RETURNS AS SOON AS THE WORK IS QUEUED, AND THIS MODEL SAYS SO RATHER THAN
/// HANDING BACK THE BODY AS IF IT WERE THE NEW NOTES. `bookings.notes.regenerate`
/// ordinarily answers `status: "pending"` with `content` still holding the
/// PREVIOUS text, and it carries no `updated_at` at all, which is why its
/// response is a third shape rather than ``SchedulingBookingNotes``. The web
/// renders the body into the notes pane and never renders its `status`, so on a
/// slow job it shows the old notes as though they were fresh. This one reports
/// what actually happened and leaves the re-read to the screen.
///
/// ⛔ NO CONFIRMATION, MATCHING THE WEB. Nothing is destroyed: the far end can
/// write the summary again, so a dialog here would be ceremony in front of a safe
/// button. ⚠️ ``onQueued`` is where a screen should schedule its own re-read; this
/// model deliberately does not poll, because nothing in the response says when the
/// job finished.
