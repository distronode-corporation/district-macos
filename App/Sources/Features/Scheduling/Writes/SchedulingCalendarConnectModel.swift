/// The Google/Microsoft calendar connection: the one hand-off on this surface that
/// leaves the app.
///
/// ⛔ IT IS NOT AN ADMIN OP AND IT CANNOT BE MADE ONE. The consent screen belongs
/// to the provider, so the round trip has to happen in a browser; the catalog has
/// no `calendar.connect`, and `GET /v1/calendar/connect` lives on the scheduler
/// behind its own session. The hand-off is therefore
/// `GET /api/district/scheduling/sso` with an explicit `next`, exactly as the web
/// console spends it for its calendar Connect link, which this mirrors.
///
/// ⛔ THE `next` IS DOUBLE-ENCODED AND THE INNER ENCODE IS THE LOAD-BEARING ONE.
/// `safeNextPath` refuses any `next` containing a literal `://` (the check that
/// stops an open redirect) and `return_to` is an ABSOLUTE URL. Encoding the return
/// URL before it is placed in `next`, and then encoding `next` as a whole, is what
/// lets an absolute URL travel inside a value that may not contain one. A single
/// encode reads correctly, passes review, and has its `next` dropped on the floor
/// at the far end, where the only symptom is landing on the scheduler's default
/// page. The outer encode is `SchedulingSSOClient`'s; the inner one is here.
///
/// ⛔ AND THE 410 GUARD DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS `next`. `isRetiredConsolePath` fires
/// for a `next` that lands on `/admin`, which is why the tenancy card's hand-off
/// can answer 410; `/v1/calendar/connect` is not that path, so this leg still
/// mints.
///
/// ⚠️ `return_to` IS THE WEB DASHBOARD'S CALENDAR PAGE, NOT A CUSTOM SCHEME, AND
/// THAT IS A DELIBERATE REFUSAL TO GUESS. `districtai://` would let
/// `ASWebAuthenticationSession` close itself on return, and nothing available here
/// establishes that the fork accepts a non-http `return_to`, it parses the value
/// and requires a host, and its behaviour beyond that is not readable from this
/// repo. The web URL is the value production already spends every day. The cost is
/// that the operator taps Done; the sheet's dismissal is what triggers the re-read,
/// so no outcome is lost either way.
///
/// ⚠️ NOTHING HERE STORES THE MINTED URL. It carries a 60-second single-use token,
/// so it is answered and presented immediately; the caller drops it when the sheet
/// dismisses, the same rule ``SchedulingModel/manageScheduling()`` follows.
