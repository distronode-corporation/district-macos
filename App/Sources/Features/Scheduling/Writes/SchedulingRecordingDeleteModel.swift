/// Deleting one recording, or every recording this tenancy holds.
///
/// ⛔ ONE MODEL FOR BOTH, AND THE TYPED CONFIRMATION IS WHAT SEPARATES THEM. They
/// share a failure mapping and a busy flag and differ in exactly one thing: the
/// bulk delete cannot be committed until the word has been typed back. Splitting
/// them would duplicate the first two and leave the third somewhere a second
/// screen could forget it.
///
/// ⛔ A PARTIAL FAILURE IS A **200**. `recordings.deleteAll` deletes per object and
/// tallies, and nothing about the status changes when some of them do not go, so
/// ``SchedulingRecordingsDeleted/failed`` is read and reported, and a non-zero one
/// is a ``SchedulingWriteState/failed(_:)`` rather than a success. On a surface
/// whose whole purpose is data removal, "all deleted" over a non-zero `failed` is
/// the worst available wrong answer.
///
/// ⚠️ NEITHER OP ECHOES ANYTHING USEFUL, so the list a screen is holding is stale
/// on return. ``onDeleted`` is the signal to re-read; this model does not hold a
/// list and must not be asked to keep one.
