/// ⛔ THE ANSWER IS THE CANCELLED BOOKING, NOT AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, AND ``onSaved``
/// HANDS IT BACK WHOLE. `updated_at` and `cancellation_reason` both move, and the
/// far end may normalise the reason it was sent, so a list that flipped its own
/// row's status would be showing a row the server does not have.
///
/// ⚠️ THE REASON IS OMITTED WHEN BLANK RATHER THAN SENT AS `""`. The catalog marks
/// it `.optional()` and `JSONValue.object(_:)` drops a nil pair, which is what
/// makes "no reason" an absent key instead of an empty one the fork would put in
/// the email.
