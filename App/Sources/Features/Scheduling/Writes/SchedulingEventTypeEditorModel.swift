/// `eventTypes.patch` answers the whole updated one. A callback that only said
/// "re-read" would throw away an answer already in hand and spend a second request
/// to get it back, and on a create it would throw away the SLUG the fork kept,
/// which is not necessarily the one that was sent.

/// ⛔ ONE MODEL FOR BOTH, AND THE MODE DECIDES WHICH OP AND WHICH FIELD SET. The
/// two schemas are not nested, `create` takes fourteen fields and REFUSES
/// fourteen that `patch` accepts (see ``SchedulingEventTypeDraft``), so the sheet
/// draws a short form on a create and the full one on an edit. Two models would
/// duplicate the name rule, the slug rule and the whole failure path to express a
/// difference that is four lines wide.
///
/// ⛔ THE REPOSITORY IS INJECTED, NEVER THE CONTAINER, WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF
/// ``SchedulingModel`` AND IS DELIBERATE. This sheet is presented BY a screen that
/// already holds the repository; taking the container would build the process's
/// token coordinator and resolve a keychain store in order to ask a question about
/// JSON, which is what stops the settings models being unit-testable.
/// ``SchedulingAdminRepository`` is a `Sendable` struct over the one ``ApiClient``,
/// so passing it costs nothing.
///
/// ⚠️ `onSaved` FIRES AFTER THE WRITE AND BEFORE THE SHEET DISMISSES, so the list
/// behind it is correct by the time it is visible again. Nothing here dismisses
/// anything: the view owns presentation.
