/// The fork refuses a range of custom hours, which is why the last-day field is
/// not merely ignored for that kind but not offered, and why ``params()`` drops a
/// leftover `endDate` rather than sending one the far end will refuse.
///
/// ⛔ AND THE RANGE CHANGES WHAT COMES BACK. With `end_date` the op answers a
/// ``SchedulingOverrideGroup`` summary and no row at all; without it, one row.
/// That is ``SchedulingOverrideCreated``, and a caller has to branch, which is
/// why this form, not the response, is documented as the thing that decides.
