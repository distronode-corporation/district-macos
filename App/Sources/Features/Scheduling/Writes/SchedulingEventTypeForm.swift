///
/// ⛔ A VALUE TYPE BESIDE THE MODEL RATHER THAN FIELDS ON IT, SO THE RULES ARE
/// TESTABLE WITHOUT A TRANSPORT. Everything a reviewer actually argues about here
/// , the slug a name produces, which numbers are refused, which fields a CREATE is
/// allowed to carry, is a pure function of what was typed, and putting it on an
/// `@Observable` class would make every one of those questions require a fake HTTP
/// stack to ask.
///
/// ⛔ EVERY NUMBER IS HELD AS A `String`, WHICH IS THE WEB'S ARRANGEMENT AND IS
/// NOT LAZINESS. A numeric field bound to an `Int` cannot hold "", so clearing the
/// duration to retype it would snap to 0 under the cursor, and 0 is a legal value
/// for four of these fields, so the snap is indistinguishable from an edit. The
/// string is the truth the operator typed; ``whole(_:atLeast:)`` is where it
/// becomes a number or a refusal.
///
/// ⚠️ AND NOTHING HERE VALIDATES WHAT THE SERVER VALIDATES. The catalog's zod
/// schema is the only validator (see the ⛔ on ``SchedulingAdminRepository``); what
/// this mirrors is exactly the set the web mirrors, for the same reason it does,
/// so a host is told before spending a request rather than after.
