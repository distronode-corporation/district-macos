/// One team's roster: who is in it, in what routing order.
///
/// ⛔ THREE OPS WITH THREE DIFFERENT ANSWER SHAPES, AND THAT IS WHY THE ROSTER IS
/// REPLACED RATHER THAN PATCHED LOCALLY. `teams.members.add` and
/// `teams.members.patch` answer the WHOLE team; `teams.members.remove` answers a
/// bare `{ok}` and nothing else, so a caller holding a roster has to re-read. This
/// model does exactly that, replace from the response where there is one, re-read
/// where there is not, and never edits its own copy, because a locally-sorted
/// rotation is a rotation the fork does not agree with.
///
/// ⛔ AND `teams.members.add` SENDS NO PRIORITY. The catalog allows one; omitting
/// it lets the fork choose, and a literal `0` would put every new member at the
/// FRONT of every rotation. The web team page omits it for the same reason.
///
/// ⚠️ THE TWO IDS ARE SPELLED DIFFERENTLY ON THE TWO OPS, `user_id` on the add,
/// `userId` on the patch and the remove. That is the catalog's spelling for a path
/// key and it is not ours to normalise; the repository holds both spellings and
/// this model passes arguments, so the asymmetry is invisible here. It is written
/// down anyway because it is the kind of thing a "tidy-up" removes.
