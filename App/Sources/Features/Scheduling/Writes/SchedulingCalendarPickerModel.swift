/// Which calendars inside one connected account are read for conflicts, and which
/// one new bookings are written to.
///
/// ⛔ THE PUT IS A REPLACE, NOT A PATCH, AND A CALENDAR LEFT OUT IS A CALENDAR
/// TURNED OFF. So this model loads the whole list, edits it in place and sends all
/// of it back, never an array built from the one row somebody touched. A holiday
/// calendar the GET reported with neither `writable` nor `primary` has to go back
/// the way it came.
///
/// ⛔ AND THE FOUR FLAGS ARE OPTIONAL FOR A REASON: absent and `false` are not the
/// same statement to the fork, and `JSONValue.object(_:)` drops a nil rather than
/// sending `false`. A row nobody touched therefore keeps its nils. ⚠️ Choosing a
/// destination is the one action that writes a flag onto EVERY row (`is_destination`
/// becomes true on one and false on the rest), which is what the browser's radio
/// group does and is the only way to say "this one, not those".
///
/// ⚠️ TWO WRITES ON SAVE, AND THE SECOND IS NOT REDUNDANT. The PUT stores which
/// calendars are checked and which is the destination; `calendar.connections.destination`
/// moves the ACCOUNT-level destination to this account. The fork's own
/// `SetAccountCalendars` does move it too, so the second call is belt and braces on
/// the one choice whose silent failure mode is "I chose it and bookings still go
/// somewhere else".
