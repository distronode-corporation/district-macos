/// The three writes a booking row carries: cancel, reschedule, reassign.
///
/// ⛔ IT LIVES ON THE LIST BECAUSE THE LIST IS WHERE THE BOOKING IS. Two of the
/// three need fields no other read answers, the reschedule needs the event type's
/// SLUG to ask for slots, the reassign needs the current host so it can be left out
/// of the candidates, and `bookings.list` is the only op that carries them. The
/// detail screen addresses a booking by id alone, which is why it offers only the
/// two writes that need nothing else (see ``SchedulingBookingCancelButton`` and
/// ``SchedulingBookingRegenerateNotesButton``).
///
/// ⛔ AND THE GATE IS TWO TESTS, NOT ONE. `client` clears the server's bar; after
/// that ``SchedulingBookingFormat/isActionable(_:now:)`` decides, on `end_at`, which
/// is why a meeting that started ten minutes ago is still cancellable and one that
/// ended ten minutes ago is not. A cancelled booking is not actionable either.
///
/// ⚠️ REASSIGN IS NARROWER AGAIN, AND ON A DIFFERENT AUTHORITY. The web offers it
/// only where the SCHEDULER reports `is_admin`, which is not the District role; the
/// list model reads it from `me.get` and hands it down here.
