/// The two editors behind the working-hours screen.
///
/// ⛔ THE WEEK EDITOR AND THE OVERRIDE EDITOR ARE SEPARATE SHEETS BECAUSE THEY ARE
/// SEPARATE WRITES. The week is a DIFF, `SchedulingWorkingHours` compares the
/// edited grid against the rules it loaded and emits creates, patches and deletes,
/// while an override is one row created or removed. Putting them in one form would
/// make an override's mistake capable of deleting a rule.
///
/// ⚠️ BOTH SHEETS LOAD THEIR OWN COPY of the rules and overrides rather than taking
/// the read screen's. The diff must be taken against what the server held when the
/// form opened, not against whatever the screen behind it read minutes ago.
///
/// ⚠️ `today` IS THE OPERATOR'S DAY, NOT THE DEVICE'S. The override list is filtered
/// from it, and a phone in another country would otherwise drop a day off that has
/// not started yet where the bookings are taken.
