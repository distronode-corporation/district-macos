/// The one place a ``SchedulingSection`` becomes a screen.

/// ⛔ SPLIT OUT OF ``RouteDestinations`` FOR THE LINE BUDGET, EXACTLY AS
/// `helpDestination` WAS. That switch is at SwiftLint's 60-line ceiling and twelve more
/// arms would not fit; what matters is that it stays EXHAUSTIVE, so a new `Route` case
/// still fails to compile there. This function is the same contract one level down: a new
/// ``SchedulingSection`` case fails to compile HERE until somebody decides what it shows.
///
/// ⛔ AND THERE IS NO PLACEHOLDER ARM, WHICH IS THE RULE ``RouteDestinations`` STATES AND
/// THIS FILE INHERITS. Every arm below renders a real screen over a real read;
/// `PlaceholderView`'s own header records that it may not be reachable from a build that
/// goes to external testers (App Store Review Guideline 2.1), and eight rows on a hub are
/// eight taps from the Overview.
///
/// ⚠️ THE ROLE IS CARRIED TO EVERY SECTION, deliberately: a signature that varied per
/// section would have to be remembered per call site, and the write stage gives all of
/// them something to gate.
