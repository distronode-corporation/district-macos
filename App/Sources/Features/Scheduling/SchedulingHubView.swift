/// **410**, so event types, availability, questions and branding are edited here.

/// does not admit gets one sentence and no control at all: App Store Review
/// Guideline 3.1.3(b) forbids the purchase, and a "contact sales" link out of a
/// paid product's own settings is that offer wearing a different hat.
///
/// ⛔ THE SECTION LIST APPEARS ONLY FOR A `live` TENANCY. Every one of the nine reads
/// answers **409 `scheduling_not_ready`** without one, so offering the rows earlier would
/// be nine links to the same refusal, and the refusal's own sentence ("Scheduling is not
/// set up for this workspace yet") is already what the card above says, better.

/// ⛔ `canManage` STILL COMES FROM THE SERVER AND IS NOT RE-DERIVED FROM THE ROLE. The
/// status route answers it for exactly this purpose; a second gate built from a role
/// STRING would fail closed on a role that did not parse and hide Enable from an owner the

/// section's download affordance, whose bar is narrower than the list beside it.
