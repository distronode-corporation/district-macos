/// ⛔ IT LIVES IN `App/` RATHER THAN IN `DistrictNetwork`, AND THAT IS THE SAME
/// DECISION `DistrictEndpoints+Scheduling.swift` RECORDS. `GET
/// /api/district/scheduling/sso` answers a 302 and not a JSON body, and it does
/// not belong on ``RedirectEndpoints`` either: that list exists for
/// `calls/{id}/recording`, where following the redirect merely wastes bandwidth.
/// Here following it SPENDS a single-use credential on a transport the user never
/// sees, so the request is issued here, once, and the `Location` is handed
/// straight to a browser sheet.
///
/// ⛔ THE BROWSER SHEET CANNOT MAKE THIS REQUEST ITSELF. `SFSafariViewController`
/// carries neither this app's bearer nor a session cookie (the API path sets none
/// at all, deliberately), so pointing it at the route would land the operator on a
/// sign-in page rather than in their scheduler.
///
/// ⛔ NOTHING HERE LOGS, STORES OR INTERPOLATES THE `Location`. It carries a
/// 60-second single-use JWT in its query string, so every message below is
/// written from the STATUS and never from the header, a "could not read that"
/// diagnostic quoting the value would put a live credential wherever the
/// diagnostic goes.
///
