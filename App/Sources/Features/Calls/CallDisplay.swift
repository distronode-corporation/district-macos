/// The display rules for one call, derived ONCE. Port of Android's `CallDisplay.kt`.
///
/// ⛔ THIS EXISTS BECAUSE THE RULES HAD ALREADY DRIFTED ON THE OTHER CLIENT, AND ONE
/// OF THE DRIFTS HID A FAILURE. The call log and the call detail screen each
/// re-derived these fields inline, with the six wire constants below copied into
/// three files. Two divergences shipped:
///
///   1. ⛔ A FAILED TRANSFER WAS INVISIBLE IN THE CALL LOG. The log rendered only the
///      `success` chip, so the one list an operator scans specifically to find calls
///      that did not reach a human was the one place that would not say so.
///   2. The detail screen appended the duration unconditionally where the log guarded
///      on `durationRaw > 0`, so a missed call read "· 0s", meaning a call that
///      never connected reported a length.
///
/// ⛔ ONE MAPPER, USED BY BOTH SCREENS. ``CallRow`` and ``CallDetailView`` construct
/// this and read nothing else off the DTO for display. Adding a comparison against a
/// wire value anywhere else is how the drift above comes back.
///
/// ⚠️ NO `import SwiftUI`, DELIBERATELY. Everything here is a pure function of the
/// wire row, so it stays readable and reviewable without a Mac. ``Tone`` is named
/// only as a value: it is declared in this same module, so it needs no import and
/// nothing here touches `Color`.
///
/// ⚠️ THE CALLER COMES FROM ``CallSummary/number``, not from `callerName`/`from`.
/// The server has ALREADY resolved `number` to a contact name where one exists,
/// falling back to the raw number and then the literal "Unknown". That is the value
/// the call screens have always shown, and `OverviewRepository.toActivity` on the
/// other client reads the other pair, a difference to preserve rather than tidy.
