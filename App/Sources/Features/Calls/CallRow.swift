    /// the WIDER of the two (~115pt). ``DistrictListRow`` sizes the trailing slot
    /// first, so those 70pt come straight off the text column, which is what was
    /// eating the time and the duration out of the subtitle.
    ///
    /// ⚠️ IT COSTS ABOUT 10pt OF ROW HEIGHT on the rows that stack, so a transfer row
    /// is slightly taller than its neighbours. Accepted: those are the rows an operator
    /// is scanning for, and losing the call's time is a worse price than losing the
    /// rhythm.
    ///
    /// ⚠️ ONE BRANCH, NOT TWO STACKED CONDITIONALS. `transferStatus` is a single value,
    /// so ``CallDisplay/transferLabel`` answers at most one badge and the stack is
    /// exactly two pills whenever it appears.
    ///
    /// ⛔ THE TRANSFER BADGE IS THE ONE THAT WAS MISSING ON ANDROID. A transfer that
    /// failed means the caller did not reach the human they were being handed to,
    /// which is the single most actionable thing in this list, and the log was the
    /// only screen that would not say so. Danger-toned so it is findable by colour
    /// while scrolling rather than only by reading.
