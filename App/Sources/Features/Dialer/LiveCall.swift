/// What the live-call surface can be asked to do, whichever direction the call

///
/// Ported from district-ios `Features/Dialer/LiveCall.swift` (see PORTING.md).
///
/// ⛔ SHARED RATHER THAN COPIED, AND THE THING BEING SHARED IS THE PART THAT
/// WOULD DRIFT. Mute, speaker, hang up and the ended-call dismissal are properties
/// of a live audio call, not of how it started: the two models drive two reducers
/// that emit the SAME ``CallCommand`` for each of them, through the same one
/// ``CallStack``. ⚠️ Each reducer wraps that command in its own type
/// (``IncomingCallCommand/engine(_:)`` and ``SoftphoneCommand/engine(_:)``) because
/// a call also has to tell the OS things the engine knows nothing about; what is
/// shared is the engine half, which is the half these four controls move. A second
/// copy of ``InCallView`` would have been a second place for "mute goes through
/// CallKit so the OS and the screen cannot disagree" to be true, and the second
/// place is the one that stops being true. The Kotlin client reached the same
/// conclusion from the other end: `IncomingCallScreen` hands straight to
/// `InCallScreen` with a `DialerHandlers`.
///
/// ⛔ IT IS THE ACTIONS ONLY, NEVER THE STATE. What each model holds underneath is
/// a different reducer with a different phase vocabulary (an outbound call can be
/// ``SoftphonePhase/ringing`` in a room while an inbound one is already in one),
/// so the view is handed a rendered ``LiveCallDisplay`` instead. Widening this
/// protocol to expose a phase would put the branch back in the view and make the
/// two vocabularies collide there.
///
/// ⚠️ `AnyObject` BECAUSE BOTH CONFORMERS ARE `@Observable` MODELS THE VIEW MUST
/// NOT COPY. A struct witness would be snapshotted into the view and the taps
/// would land on a value nobody owns.
///
/// ⚠️ `Sendable` IS STATED RATHER THAN INFERRED, AND IT COSTS NEITHER CONFORMER A
/// LINE. Both are `@MainActor final class`es and are therefore implicitly
/// `Sendable` already; what the refinement buys is that `any LiveCallControls` is
/// Sendable too, which is what lets a view's `Task { await controls.hangUp() }`
/// capture it. Without it the existential loses the guarantee its conformers have,
/// and the button that ends a call does not compile.
