/// ⛔ ONE DESTINATION FOR BOTH, BECAUSE THEY ARE ONE DESTINATION. See the ⛔ on
/// `Route.dialer`: an in-call destination reached by navigation is restored from the
/// path after process death and the effect that starts the call runs again, placing a
/// SECOND billable call to the same person with no user action. Swapping the content of
/// one destination has no such restore path, a killed process comes back to an idle
/// keypad, which is the truth, because the socket died with it.
///
/// ⚠️ THE MODEL IS NOT THE CALL'S OWNER FOR LIFETIME PURPOSES. This `@State` dies with
/// the destination; the call does not. ``DialerModel`` takes the call claim on the
/// process-lifetime stack held by ``AppContainer`` for exactly the length of one call, so a screen popped mid-call
/// leaves the call
/// running with an owner still driving it. See the ⛔ on that model.
///
/// ⛔ AND A SCREEN REBUILT AROUND A LIVE CALL RE-ATTACHES TO THAT OWNER. Choosing another
/// sidebar section and then Dial again destroys this view while the call goes on; a fresh model here would draw an
/// idle keypad over a live call, with the hang-up nowhere on screen and every new dial
/// refused as busy. ``CallStack/softphone`` is where the owner is found, and the model
/// registers itself there when it takes the claim.
/// ⚠️ This is not a restore after process death, which the ⛔ on `Route.dialer` rules
/// out: a killed process holds no owner, so it still comes back to an idle keypad.
