import SwiftUI

/// One live call, while it is happening, in either direction.
///
/// ⚠️ IT SERVES BOTH DIRECTIONS, WHICH IS WHY IT TAKES A ``LiveCallDisplay`` AND A
/// ``LiveCallControls`` RATHER THAN A ``DialerModel``. Everything below is a
/// property of a live audio call and not of how it started; the RING is the part
/// that genuinely differs, and that is drawn by ``IncomingCallView`` and never
/// reaches here. The file lives under `Features/Dialer/`, beside the outbound call.
///
/// ⛔ NO VIDEO TILE AND NO CAMERA CONTROL EXIST HERE, AND NONE MAY BE ADDED. The
/// softphone publishes no video in either direction: ``CallCommand`` has no camera case
/// and ``CallEngine`` has no camera member, so a control here would have nothing to
/// call, and the token the dial route mints WOULD permit publishing. A camera track
/// pushed into a `direct_` room would be encoded, uploaded and billed with nobody able
/// to see it, because the far end is a telephone. The absence is the enforcement.
///
/// ⛔ "Calling…" AND THE TIMER ARE DIFFERENT PHASES AND NEVER BOTH. `POST
/// /api/district/calls/dial` returns as soon as the carrier accepts, so being in the
/// room is not being on a call; ``SoftphonePhase/ringing`` is its own phase and the
/// duration starts at ``SoftphonePhase/connected``, which is the participant join. A
/// duration shown during the ring would count ringing as conversation, on the number an
/// operator compares against an invoice.
///
/// ⛔ RECONNECTING IS A BANNER OVER THE CALL, NEVER A PHASE, which is why it is drawn
/// as a second line rather than replacing the first. A phone walking out of wifi onto
/// its radio does this routinely and the SDK recovers by itself; ``CallMediaState`` says
/// so on ``CallMediaState/reconnecting``.
///
/// ⚠️ THE ENDED STATE IS A SCREEN, NOT AN IMMEDIATE POP. The operator needs to see the
/// duration and be told the record is the call log; a surface that vanished on hang-up
/// would answer "how long was that" with nothing.
