/// separate server reads, so a failure of one is rendered inside its own card with
/// the others' figures still on screen. The whole-screen failure is reached only when
/// EVERY read failed and there is genuinely nothing left to preserve. See
/// ``AnalyticsState``.
///
/// ⚠️ THIS FILE OWNS THE SHELL ONLY, the scroll view, the window selector and the
/// three top-level states. The cards live in `AnalyticsCards.swift` and
/// `AnalyticsUsageCards.swift`, their chrome in `AnalyticsChrome.swift` and their
/// arithmetic in `AnalyticsFormat.swift`, which is the same seam the Android screen
/// was split along.
///
/// ⚠️ ONE `task`, NOT TWO. The Overview watches both the workspace id and the session
/// epoch because it is a TAB that survives a sign-out and a tenant switch; this is a
/// pushed destination whose workspace id is carried in the ``Route`` itself, and a
/// session that ends underneath it takes the whole stack with it.
