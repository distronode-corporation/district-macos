/// carries today are not the keys it carried last month, and a struct pinned here
/// would break the screen on every prompt revision, silently, since a decode
/// failure on an Optional just yields nil. The shape is walked at render time
/// instead, and this is the intermediate the walk produces.
///
/// ⛔ AND THE WALK MUST NEVER THROW OR DROP. This is the one place in the app
/// rendering data no gate validates: the contract fixtures pin the CONTAINER
/// (`intelligence` is an object) and say nothing about what is inside it. Every
/// branch below therefore has a fallback, and the fallback is always "show the raw
/// JSON" rather than "show nothing", an operator who can see an unfamiliar shape
/// can report it, whereas a silently dropped field looks like an enrichment that
/// found nothing.
