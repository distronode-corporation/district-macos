/// Starting a video room with one contact and telling them how to get in.
///
/// ⛔ THREE STEPS AND ONLY ONE OF THEM CAN BE TAKEN BACK. It mints a room name, asks for a
/// token (which is what produces the shareable guest invite), and SENDS that invite to the
/// contact, a metered, non-idempotent carrier segment or Postmark send, capped at 30/min
/// per workspace. The room and the token cost nothing; the message is money and cannot be
/// recalled. So: one deliberate tap is one attempt, and ⛔ NOTHING HERE RETRIES. A timeout
/// on the send means the message may well have gone out, and a second attempt is a second
/// charge and a duplicate to a customer.
///
/// ⛔ THE ROOM IS MINTED BY ``RoomName/init(workspaceId:suffix:)`` AND BY NOTHING ELSE, so
/// this cannot produce a `video_` name. That prefix is one character from `meet_` in the
/// same `startsWith` chain server-side and silently starts a BILLABLE Tavus avatar whose
/// default concurrency ceiling is 1, the first accidental one is both a charge and an
/// outage of the avatar feature for every other room. There is no code path from here to
/// one, structurally, and there must not be.
///
/// ⛔ AND AN AI-AVATAR ROOM IS OUT OF SCOPE ON PURPOSE, not merely unimplemented: it is
/// unmintable here (above), billable, and concurrency-capped at one across the service.
/// ⛔ SCREEN SHARE IS ALSO OUT, and for a different reason: it needs a Broadcast Upload
/// Extension and an App Group, which is a target and an entitlement rather than a feature
/// flag. Neither belongs in a contact screen; each is a piece of work of its own.
///
/// ⚠️ TWO TOKEN CALLS HAPPEN FOR ONE TAP AND THAT IS UNDERSTOOD RATHER THAN ACCIDENTAL.
/// This one exists to obtain the guest invite; ``ActiveRoomModel`` mints its own when the
/// operator actually joins, because a join needs a fresh 30-minute LiveKit token. Both are
/// for the same room, and only ONE invite ever leaves the device. ``RoomsRepository``'s ⛔
/// forbids calling the route on a REDRAW, which this does not: it is reached from a button.
