/// Who this account has blocked, shared by every screen that has to say so.
///
/// ⛔ ONE INSTANCE ON ``AppContainer``, NOT ONE PER SCREEN, AND THE REASON IS THE
/// GUIDELINE. App Store Review Guideline 1.2 asks that blocking a user remove their
/// content from view **immediately**, so the thread screen that performs the block
/// and the inbox list that must stop showing the thread have to agree without a
/// round trip, and they are different views with different models. A per-screen copy
/// would make "is this caller blocked" a question about whichever model was asked
/// last, which on a phone is whichever screen the user happens to be standing on.
///
/// ⛔ IT IS A CACHE IN FRONT OF THE SERVER, NEVER THE AUTHORITY. `conversations`
/// stops returning threads for a blocked contact server-side, so this exists for
/// immediacy and not for enforcement. ⚠️ The two can therefore disagree for one
/// refresh, in both directions: a thread blocked on another device is still in this
/// list until the next read, and a thread blocked here is gone from the UI before
/// the server's own filter has been observed. Neither is a failure and nothing may
/// report one.
///
/// ⛔ KEYED ON `contactId` AND NOT ON A PHONE NUMBER. A number has to be
/// re-normalised to be compared (bare digits server-side, and the wire carries E.164
/// with punctuation), and doing that here would be a second normaliser that could
/// disagree with the server's phone normaliser, the classic failure where two sides
/// of a comparison normalise differently and the read silently returns nothing.
/// The server answers a `contactId` for every block,
/// including one asked for by number, precisely so a client never has to.
///
/// ⚠️ THE WORKSPACE IS CARRIED WITH THE SET RATHER THAN ASSUMED. ``ContactsView``
/// and ``InboxView`` are rebuilt on a workspace switch but this object is not, so a
/// set loaded for one tenant must not be read as another's, ``isBlocked(_:in:)``
/// refuses rather than answering false, because "I do not know" and "not blocked"
/// are different and only one of them may hide a badge.
