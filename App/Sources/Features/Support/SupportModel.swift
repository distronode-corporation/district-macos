/// The support request list, and the form that raises a new one.

/// ⛔ "SUPPORT" IS THE TENANT'S TICKETS **WITH DISTRONODE**. Its mirror image is the
/// desk, which is their own customers' tickets with them. Nothing on this model may
/// be reworded so that it could describe either.
///
/// ⛔ THE IDEMPOTENCY KEY IS MINTED ONCE PER COMPOSED DRAFT AND SURVIVES A FAILED
/// SUBMIT, WHICH IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS WRITE IS REPEATABLE AT ALL. The server
/// claims the key before it calls Atlassian and answers a re-used one with
/// `deduplicated: true`, so a retry carrying the SAME key collapses onto the first
/// request, while a retry that minted a fresh one would put a second ticket in a
/// human's queue. ⚠️ The web mints it per SUBMIT, which is correct there because its
/// form has no retry affordance; here the button comes back after a failure, so the
/// key has to outlive the attempt. It is cleared when a draft is abandoned or
/// succeeds, never between attempts at the same draft.
///
/// ⛔ EVERY ROUTE BEHIND THIS SCREEN EXCLUDES `viewer`, THE READS INCLUDED, which is
/// the opposite split from knowledge and messaging. So there is no read-only mode
/// here: ``RouteGate`` hides the destination outright and this model still re-checks
/// ``canWrite`` at each call site, because a control that was not drawn is not a
/// boundary and the server's `requireWorkspaceRole` is.
///
/// ⚠️ NO CACHE AND NO POLLING. The list is opened to find out whether somebody has
/// answered, which is the one question a stale copy is worst at.
