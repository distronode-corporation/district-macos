/// instead of triaging a report about a fictional `+1 555 01xx` caller.

/// a Release build where `SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS` does not carry `DEBUG`
/// (measured on this project with `xcodebuild -showBuildSettings`, not assumed), so a
/// shipped binary has no argument to arm and no string to find. ⚠️ It grants nothing
/// either way: the only thing it changes is five words in a subject line.

/// the published sub-processor list does not cover it.
///

/// a durable local row BEFORE it calls Atlassian and files under the reporting
/// workspace's own region, so a report survives a vendor outage and stays in region.
/// A bespoke `/report` route would have had to re-earn both.
///
/// ⛔ `kind` IS `problem`, WHICH IS THE SERVER'S OWN DEFAULT AND THE ONLY DEFENSIBLE
/// CHOICE OF THE THREE. `question` and `suggestion` map to Jira request types whose
/// queues nobody watches for moderation, and the kind is mapped to a request type id
/// SERVER-SIDE precisely so a client cannot file into an arbitrary one.
///
/// ⛔ NOTHING MAY BE ADDED TO THE PAYLOAD. It is exactly `kind`, `subject`, `message`
/// and the key: the desk's `requestFieldValues` accepts only the fields the request
/// TYPE exposes on its portal form, and an unknown field is a hard 400 raised AFTER
/// the local claim row exists, which would fail every report filed. So the thread id
/// goes in the MESSAGE, which is where the support desk's own claim marker goes for
/// the same reason.
///
/// ⚠️ THE SUPPORT ROUTES EXCLUDE `viewer` SERVER-SIDE, so the caller gates this on
/// ``WorkspaceRole/allowsMutation(_:)`` and a read-only seat is not offered the
/// control. ⛔ THAT IS A KNOWN GAP AGAINST GUIDELINE 1.2 RATHER THAN A DESIGN: the
/// guideline asks that anyone who can SEE the content be able to flag it, and a
/// viewer can see it. Closing it is a server change (admit `viewer` on the create
/// route, or give reports their own route), not a client one, offering the control
/// anyway would only walk a viewer into a 403 they cannot act on, which is the rule
/// every other gated control on this client follows.
