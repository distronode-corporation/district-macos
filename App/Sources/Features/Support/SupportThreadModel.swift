/// One support request: its conversation, a reply, and the close.
///
/// ⛔ THE THREAD IS SHOWN IN FULL, AND THE RULE THAT SAYS OTHERWISE BELONGS TO A
/// DIFFERENT SURFACE. `/api/internal/support-lookup`, the VOICE path, returns
/// status and never a body, because a phone call is authenticated by spoofable
/// caller ID. This screen runs under the operator's own session bearer inside an
/// authenticated app, so withholding the conversation would make it useless without
/// protecting anything.
///
/// ⛔ NEITHER WRITE IS RETRIED AND NEITHER RE-ARMS ITSELF AFTER AN AMBIGUOUS
/// FAILURE. Both post a PUBLIC comment: the reply posts the customer's own text
/// always, and the close posts an audit note naming who asked between resolving the
/// transition and applying it, so a repeat that still finds one leaves a second
/// visible message in a thread the customer reads. ``SupportResubmit`` holds the
/// rule; this model applies it at both call sites.
