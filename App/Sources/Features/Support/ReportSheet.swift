/// dismiss the alert and drop the server's own sentence somewhere the operator is no
/// longer looking. Here the failure stays in the sheet beside the note they typed.
///
/// ⛔ IT DOES NOT DISMISS ITSELF ON SUCCESS. Apple's ask is that the reviewer SEE the

/// be indistinguishable on video from one that failed. The confirmation is the
/// screen, and Done is the way out.
