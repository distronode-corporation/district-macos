/// ⛔ ITS OWN FILE, AND THAT IS WORTH MORE THAN THE LINE COUNT IT SAVES: this is the
/// only place in the app that displays a meeting TRANSCRIPT, so keeping it here makes
/// that surface one file to review rather than a section of a longer one. The Kotlin
/// client split it out for the same reason.
///
/// ⛔ THE TRANSCRIPT IS BEHIND AN EXPLICIT SECTION LABEL AND IS NOT THE FIRST THING
/// SHOWN. It is every word everybody said, unredacted and unsummarised; the minutes
/// are what somebody opening this actually wants, and putting the raw conversation
/// first would mean the sensitive thing is what appears on screen before anyone has
/// decided to read it. `MeetingDetail.transcript` carries the same ⚠️ on the wire type.
///
/// ⛔ AND THERE IS NO PLAY CONTROL. The `Meeting` model has no recording column and
/// neither meetings route has a recording sibling; the artefacts are these two.
///
/// ⚠️ SCROLLS INTERNALLY. A transcript is arbitrarily long, and a sheet that grew with
/// it would push its own dismiss control off the screen.
struct MeetingRecordSheet: View {
    /// ⚠️ OPTIONAL BECAUSE THE SHEET'S PRESENTATION IS DRIVEN BY THE SAME VALUE. nil
    /// is only reachable during the dismissal animation, and it draws the loading
    /// state rather than an empty sheet.
