/// One live `meet_` room, for as long as its destination exists.
///
/// ⛔ THE JOIN IS A DELIBERATE PRESS AND IS NEVER AN EFFECT, WHICH IS THE ONE RULE ON
/// THIS SCREEN THAT IS NOT NEGOTIABLE AND IS ALSO WHERE THIS CLIENT DIVERGES FROM
/// ANDROID. `Route.activeRoom` is an ordinary navigation destination, so it is
/// RESTORED FROM THE PATH after process death; the Kotlin screen joins from its
/// permission-launcher effect, which on iOS would mean a killed phone coming back and
/// silently re-entering a room, re-dispatching its Companion and putting a live
/// microphone in somebody's pocket. `Route.dialer`'s own ⛔ refuses to have an in-call
/// route for exactly this reason, and rooms cannot take that escape because the room
/// name has to survive in the destination. So the screen opens on ``RoomPhase/idle``
/// with a Join control, and nothing connects until it is pressed.
///
/// ⛔ IT OWNS AT MOST ONE ``RoomEngine`` AT A TIME, AND A NEW ONE PER JOIN. The engine
/// holds a live socket and the device's audio route, and a LiveKit `Room` does not
/// support a second `connect` after it has disconnected, so a rejoin drops the dead
/// engine and builds a fresh one rather than re-pointing the old one. ⚠️ The
/// destination is keyed on the room NAME, so navigating to a DIFFERENT room builds a
/// different model.
///
/// ⛔ AND IT REFUSES TO JOIN WHILE A TELEPHONE CALL IS LIVE. One process owns one
/// `AVAudioSession`: the softphone's ``AudioSessionCoordinator`` configures it while
/// CallKit activates it, and ``RoomEngine/connect(url:token:)`` hands the session back
/// to the SDK's own automation. Both are correct for their own case and they cannot
/// both be right at once, so the overlap is prevented rather than arbitrated in the
/// audio layer.
///
/// ⛔ AND THE EXCLUSION IS MUTUAL. The predicate is ``CallStack/hasLiveCall``, the
/// claim both call models use on each other, which is true for the WHOLE of a call;
/// ``CallStack/engine`` is built at MEDIA time and would miss the 30-second inbound
/// ring and the outbound window between the Call tap and the dial being accepted,
/// while the copy promises "There is a call on this device. End it before joining a
/// room." And the call path has to know about rooms, or nothing refuses, mutes or
/// leaves a ROOM when a call starts: an operator could answer a customer while a
/// meeting held a live microphone, and the meeting would hear the whole private call
/// while the caller heard the meeting. So this model takes
/// ``CallStack/claimRoom(_:)`` for the length of a join and conforms to ``RoomAudio``
/// so the call path can take the audio back.
///
/// ⛔ THAT CLAIM IS ALSO THIS OBJECT'S LIFETIME, EXACTLY AS ``DialerModel``'S IS. The
/// container holds it while a room is live, so a screen destroyed by a sign-out or a
/// workspace switch cannot strand a publishing microphone with no owner. Nothing else
/// would tear it down: ``leave()`` is the only other caller of `disconnect()`, and
/// there is no `deinit` (a `@MainActor` class's `deinit` is nonisolated under Swift 6
/// and could not touch these properties).
///
/// ⛔ ``canPublish`` IS THE ROLE'S ANSWER AND IT FAILS CLOSED, through
/// ``WorkspaceRole/allowsMutation(_:)`` like every other write gate. Never
/// `role != .viewer` on its own: a nil role is what `WorkspaceRole.fromWire` returns
/// for a value the route could not parse, and `nil != .viewer` is TRUE, so that
/// expression would hand an UNKNOWN role publish rights. ⚠️ It is an affordance, not
/// an enforcement: a viewer's token carries `canPublish:false` and the media server
/// refuses either track whatever this client believes.
