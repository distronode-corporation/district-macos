/// ⛔ IT OPENS ON A JOIN CONTROL AND CONNECTS TO NOTHING BY ITSELF. See the ⛔ on
/// ``ActiveRoomModel``: `Route.activeRoom` is restored from the navigation path after
/// process death, so a `.task` that joined would re-enter a room, re-dispatch its
/// Companion and open a microphone with nobody having asked. This is the one place
/// this client deliberately diverges from the Kotlin screen, which joins from its
/// permission-launcher effect.
///
/// ⛔ `reconnecting` IS A BANNER OVER THE MEETING, NEVER A FAILURE SCREEN. A phone
/// walking out of wifi onto its radio disconnects and resumes within seconds and the
/// SDK does that recovery itself; swapping the grid for an error would tear down a
/// meeting that was about to come back, during exactly the ordinary event it is meant
/// to survive. The tiles stay on screen.
///
/// ⛔ THE COMPANION IS A CHIP AND NOT A TILE, AND BOTH HALVES ARE DELIBERATE. It
/// publishes no media, so a tile would be a blank rectangle in the middle of the grid;
/// it is also transcribing the conversation, so hiding it entirely would mean people
/// are recorded without the screen ever saying so.
///
/// ⛔ A DENIED PERMISSION DEGRADES THE ROOM, IT DOES NOT REFUSE IT. No camera is
/// audio-only attendance; no microphone is listen-only attendance, which is precisely
/// the seat a viewer is given by the server anyway. Both are stated on screen so
/// nobody wonders why a control is inert.
///
/// ⚠️ NO `NavigationStack` OF ITS OWN. ``ShellView`` provides one per tab and
/// registers `navigationDestination(for: Route.self)` on it exactly once.
