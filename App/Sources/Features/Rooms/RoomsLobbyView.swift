/// The rooms lobby: start a meeting, or read the minutes of one that already
/// happened.
///
/// ⛔ THE MINUTES ARE THE REASON THIS SCREEN EXISTS, NOT A SECONDARY LIST. The
/// Companion joins every `meet_` room and writes them up; without somewhere to read
/// them the feature is invisible on a phone. So a completed meeting shows its preview
/// inline rather than hiding it behind a tap.
///
/// ⛔ AND THE PREVIEW IS LABELLED AS ONE. The server truncates to 220 characters, so
/// presenting it as "the minutes" would quietly deliver two sentences where a page was
/// written. ⛔ NOTHING HERE OFFERS PLAYBACK: `MeetingResponses.swift` says the
/// `Meeting` model has no recording column at all and neither route has a recording
/// sibling, so a play control would be a control with nothing behind it.
///
/// ⚠️ THE JOIN FORM STAYS USABLE WHEN THE HISTORY READ FAILS. They are unrelated
/// server surfaces, and gating the field on the list would turn an outage of the
/// archive into an inability to hold a meeting.
///
/// ⛔ AND AN EMPTY LIST IS NEVER STATED AS "there are no meetings" WITHOUT CHECKING
/// WHETHER THE PAGE WAS EMPTY. See the ⛔ on ``meetingList(_:)``.
///
/// ⚠️ NO `NavigationStack` OF ITS OWN. ``ShellView`` provides one per tab and
/// registers `navigationDestination(for: Route.self)` on it exactly once; this screen
/// appends a ``Route`` to that stack through `NavigationLink(value:)`.
