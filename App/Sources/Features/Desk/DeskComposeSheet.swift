/// CUSTOMER's words rather than the team's, it is their problem, and attributing it to
/// the team would make the thread read as us talking to ourselves.
///
/// ⛔ THE DRAFT LIVES HERE AND NOT ON THE MODEL, so a dismissed sheet takes it with it
/// and a reopened one starts clean. ⚠️ It survives a FAILED submit, though: losing a
/// typed ticket to a failed request would be two losses for one fault.
///
/// ⚠️ THE THREE REQUESTER BOXES MAY ALL BE BLANK. A ticket with no contact details is
/// legitimate; what is not legitimate is sending one of them as an empty string, which
/// fails `.email()` server-side and takes the whole request down. The repository trims
/// to nil, and this form never has to know that.
