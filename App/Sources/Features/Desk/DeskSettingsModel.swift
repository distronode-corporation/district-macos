/// ⛔ EVERY WRITE HERE PATCHES ONE KEY AND ADOPTS ONLY WHAT THE SERVER ECHOES BACK.
/// Sending the whole form would make this screen the writer of values it may have
/// read before another operator changed them on the web, and, after a failed load,
/// a form that writes blanks over live configuration. ``DeskRepository/updateSettings`` drops every nil,
/// which is the mechanism; passing one field per call is the discipline.
///
/// ⛔ THE BRAND-NAME DRAFT IS SEEDED ONLY FROM A SUCCESSFUL READ, AND `nil` IS NOT
/// `""`. Seeding an empty box from a read that FAILED and then saving would write a
/// blank over the heading a tenant's own customers see. That is why ``brandDraft``
/// starts nil and the field is not editable until a read has landed.
///
/// ⛔ TWO CONSEQUENCES OF `enabled` LAND ON A LIVE CALL, the agent's unresolved-call
/// teardown re-routes into this queue, and callers can ask it for the status of their
/// own requests, so the copy says both BEFORE the switch is flipped. Opt-in is the
/// whole safety story for this feature.
