/// Support is the tenant writing to DISTRONODE. A shortened title on either surface
/// undoes the distinction in one word.
///
/// ⛔ FOUR SCREENS, NOT TWO, AND THE FOURTH IS THE ONE THIS REPO KEEPS LOSING. On,
/// off, could-not-ask and empty are four different facts. An empty queue drawn for a

/// read that FAILED it says the same thing with even less basis. ``DeskAvailability``
/// is what keeps them apart and this view renders all four.
///

/// `navigationDestination(for: Route.self)` on it exactly once; SwiftUI resolves that
/// by TYPE, so a second registration here would be a runtime coin toss rather than a
/// compile error.
///
/// ⚠️ A `List` DRAWN TO LOOK LIKE THE PADDED STACK IT WAS, so the open ticket can stay
/// selected beside its thread on regular width. Each block is a row spaced as the stack
/// spaced it, and the queue's card is one slice per ticket; `StackedListRows.swift`
