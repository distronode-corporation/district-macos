/// One row of the Inbox search results.
///
/// ⛔ NOT A ``ConversationRow``, AND NOT A NARROWER ONE. A hit is one message and a
/// conversation row is a thread: the row above shows a channel set, a delivery
/// status, a draft chip and an unread count, and the search route sends none of
/// those. Reusing it would mean either drawing four empty slots or inventing
/// values, and the second is how a client ends up asserting a delivery it cannot
/// confirm.
///
/// ⛔ NOT A ``DistrictListRow`` EITHER, WHICH IS THE ONE DESIGN-SYSTEM DEPARTURE
/// HERE. That component is title + one-line subtitle + two slots, and this row has
/// three facts to show, who, when, and the text that matched, where the matched
/// text is the whole reason the row exists and must not be truncated to a single
/// line. Putting the instant in the trailing slot would give it `layoutPriority(1)`
/// over the name, and putting the body in the subtitle would cap it at one line.
/// So the row is built here, with the same 56pt floor, gutters and type ramp.
///
/// ⛔ NO TAP HANDLER. Wrapped in a `NavigationLink` by ``InboxView``, for the
/// disclosure affordance, the press highlight and the accessibility button trait.
/// See the ⛔ on ``DistrictListRow``.
