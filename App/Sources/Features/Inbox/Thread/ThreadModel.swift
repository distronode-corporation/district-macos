/// pushed-and-popped screen would also lose it.
///
/// ⚠️ PROCESS DEATH IS COVERED SEPARATELY. On its own this would bring a killed app back
/// to whatever the last autosave persisted rather than to the last keystroke;
/// ``flushDraft()``, in `ThreadDraftFlush.swift`, writes the composer when the scene
/// stops being active, which is where iOS puts an app before it suspends and later
/// kills it. ⚠️ A FOREGROUND
/// crash still loses the last edit, and `SavedStateHandle` does not survive one either:
/// it is written at the same point in the Android lifecycle.
///
/// ⛔ AUTOSAVE IS A DEBOUNCE, NOT A KEYSTROKE WRITE. The drafts route allows 60
/// writes/min per WORKSPACE and the budget is shared across every operator in it, so
