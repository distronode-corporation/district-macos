/// FORCED RATHER THAN CHOSEN. A thread is a timeline with a composer pinned to the
/// bottom; there is no stable place in it for two controls that must be reachable
/// from a conversation of any length, and a reviewer watching a recording has to
/// find them without scrolling. ⚠️ It is also the only surface on this client with a
/// toolbar menu, `ContactsView` and `InboxView` carry single-item toolbars, so the
/// identifiers matter more than usual.
///
/// ⛔ THE BLOCK POPS THIS SCREEN AND THE REPORT DOES NOT. Blocking takes the thread
/// out of the inbox list immediately (Apple asks that the content leave view at
/// once), so staying on a screen the list no longer contains would leave the
/// operator looking at something they cannot get back to. Reporting changes nothing
/// about what is visible and must not move them.
///
/// ⛔ NEITHER CONTROL IS IN `UITestApp.forbiddenSurfaces`, WHICH IS A DECISION. That
/// set guards writes that are irreversible or billed against the live workspace; a
/// block takes the desired STATE, so an unblock puts the row back, and a report is
/// what the recording exists to show. What keeps it safe is the DATA: the harness
/// only ever blocks a fictional `+1 555 01xx` demo contact.
