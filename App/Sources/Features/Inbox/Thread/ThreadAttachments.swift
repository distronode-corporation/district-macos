/// ⛔ A SIBLING FILE FOR THE REASON `ThreadDraftFlush.swift` AND `ThreadDraftRestore.swift`
/// BOTH GIVE: `ThreadModel.swift` sits within a few lines of the 500 `swiftlint --strict`
/// allows (`file_length` warns at 500 and every warning is an error in CI), and stored
/// properties such as the email subject need room in the type's own body, a stored
/// property cannot live in an extension. The attachment half is the largest piece that
/// stands WHOLE on its own, so it is the one that lives here.
///
/// ⚠️ IT WIDENS NOTHING'S ACCESS. ``ThreadModel/current``, ``ThreadModel/setContent(_:)``,
/// ``ThreadModel/inbox`` and ``ThreadModel/target`` are already internal for the two
/// files above; `attachmentFileName` is not `private` (`private` is file-scoped and its
/// only reader is ``attach(_:mimeType:)``, which is here) and is unreachable from
/// anywhere else because App is one module with no second caller.
