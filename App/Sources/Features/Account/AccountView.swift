/// The account surface: sign out, reach the device list, and start account
/// deletion. Ported from Android's `SettingsScreen.kt`, whose header decisions are
/// carried over below rather than re-derived.
///
/// ⛔ THIS SCREEN EXISTS BECAUSE THE STORES REQUIRE IT, NOT BECAUSE THE PRODUCT
/// ASKED FOR IT. App Store Review Guideline 5.1.1(v) requires an app that supports
/// account creation to offer an in-app route to INITIATE account deletion, and
/// reviewers check for sign-out in the same pass. Play's User Data policy says the
/// same thing, which is why Android grew this screen first. A submission missing
/// either route is a rejection, not a nit.
///
/// ⛔ SCROLLABLE, AND THAT IS A REVIEW FIX RATHER THAN POLISH. One more row is
/// enough to push the ACCOUNT card, whose only row is the mandatory deletion entry
/// point, off the bottom of a small screen, where neither a reviewer nor a user can
/// reach it. The container has to grow rather than clip, on every device and at
/// every Dynamic Type size.
///
/// ⚠️ FEW ROWS, AND DELIBERATELY NOT A SETTINGS TASK. There
/// is nothing here the app can CONFIGURE (no notification channels, no theme
/// choice), so anything more would be placeholders. Devices earned its row by
/// being real: it is the only place an account's live sessions are visible, and
/// without it the two revoke routes are unreachable because a `deviceId` is
/// client-generated and opaque.
///
/// ⚠️ DEVICES SITS IN THE SESSION CARD, NOT THE ACCOUNT ONE. Signing another
/// device out ends a session; the account card's only row starts an irreversible
/// deletion, and grouping a routine action beside it would borrow that weight.
///
/// ⛔ NO PURCHASE PATH ANYWHERE ON THIS SCREEN. App Store Review Guideline 3.1.3(b)
/// forbids one, and an account screen is exactly where a "manage subscription" or
/// "upgrade" row would look natural. Billing is read-only in this app and lives
/// behind ``Route/billing(workspaceId:role:)``.
///
/// ⚠️ NO `NavigationStack` OF ITS OWN. ``ShellView`` provides one per tab and
/// registers `navigationDestination(for: Route.self)` exactly once inside it;
/// SwiftUI resolves that by TYPE, so a second stack here would be a runtime coin
/// toss rather than a compile error.
