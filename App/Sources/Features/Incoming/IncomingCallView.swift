import DistrictCall
import SwiftUI

/// One inbound call, from the ring to the hang-up.
///
/// ⛔ THE CONNECTED HALF IS ``InCallView``, REUSED RATHER THAN REBUILT. Mute,
/// speaker, hang up, the duration, the reconnecting banner and the ended summary
/// are identical for an inbound and an outbound call, they are properties of a
/// live audio call, not of how it started, and a second copy would be the thing
/// that drifts. What is genuinely different is the RING, which outbound does not
/// have, and that is the only part drawn here. The Kotlin `IncomingCallScreen`
/// makes exactly this split.
///
/// ⛔ THE PHASE GATES THE HAND-OVER, NOT THE PRESENCE OF MEDIA, AND THE DIFFERENCE
/// IS VISIBLE. ``IncomingCallPhase/answering`` is a phase of its own rather than a
/// spinner over the ring, because the two accept different input: Answer and
/// Decline are both live while ringing, and once the answer round trip is out
/// neither may be pressed again. Branching on `media != nil` instead would draw
/// the in-call surface with a live Hang up button over a call that has not been
/// joined, and skip the connecting state entirely.
///
/// ⛔ THE BUTTONS ARE CHOSEN BY PHASE, NOT DISABLED BY IT. A disabled Answer on a
/// call that is already connecting is a control that looks momentarily broken; an
/// absent one is a state change the user can read. And a decline landing mid-join
/// would tear down a call whose credential has already been spent and whose
/// rendezvous the server has already read.
///
/// ⚠️ A FLOATING PANEL OF ITS OWN RATHER THAN A NAVIGATION DESTINATION (iOS uses a
/// full-screen cover for the same reason): a destination restored after relaunch
/// would re-run whatever put it there, which here would be a ringing screen for a
/// call that died with the process. See ``RingPanelController``.
