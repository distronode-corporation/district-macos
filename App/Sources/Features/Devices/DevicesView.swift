/// Every install signed in to this account, and the two ways to end one. Ported
/// from Android's `DevicesScreen.kt`, whose header decisions are carried over
/// rather than re-derived.
///
/// ⛔ BOTH DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS ARE CONFIRMED, AND THEY ARE NOT EQUALLY
/// DESTRUCTIVE. Signing out one device is recoverable by signing back in on it;
/// "sign out everywhere" includes the phone in the user's hand and logs them out
/// mid-tap. Neither is a mis-tap away, and the three prompts say different things
/// because a shared confirmation would understate the second.
///
/// ⛔ REVOKING THIS DEVICE, OR EVERYWHERE, RUNS THE LOCAL SIGN-OUT TOO. The server
/// has no way to tell this process that its credential just died, it will simply
/// 401 on the next request, so this screen drives ``SessionModel/signOut()``
/// itself and the app returns to the sign-in gate rather than sitting on a dead
/// session. ⚠️ Revoking ANOTHER device must not touch the local session, which is
/// why ``DevicesModel`` answers which case happened instead of assuming.
///
/// ⛔ THE ROW FOR THIS DEVICE IS MARKED, AND THAT MARKING IS SAFETY RATHER THAN
/// POLISH. Device names are client-supplied free text, so two identical handsets
/// on one account produce two identical-looking rows; without the marker, "sign
/// out the one that is not mine" is a coin flip, and losing it means signing out
/// the phone you are holding while the lost one stays live. The marker is derived
/// from the opaque installation id, never from the name.
///
/// ⚠️ "Last active" IS DELIBERATELY VAGUE AND UNDERSTATES ON PURPOSE. The server
/// stamps `lastUsedAt` only when a refresh token ROTATES, so the value trails real
/// use by up to about ten minutes and stops moving entirely on a device that is
/// signed in but unopened. Calling it "last used" would be a claim the data cannot
/// support.
///
/// ⚠️ NO `NavigationStack` OF ITS OWN. ``ShellView`` provides one per tab and
/// registers `navigationDestination(for: Route.self)` on it exactly once; SwiftUI
/// resolves that by TYPE, so a second registration here would be a runtime coin
/// toss rather than a compile error.
