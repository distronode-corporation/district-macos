/// PRESENTED **BEFORE** A USER SIGNS IN, not buried in an Account screen behind the

/// ⛔ THIS IS NOT A CROSSING OF `SignInView`'s "NO OTHER PATH OUT OF THIS SCREEN"
/// RULE, AND THE DISTINCTION IS THE GUIDELINE RATHER THAN THE URL. That rule is
/// about Guideline 3.1.3(b): an offer to create an account, subscribe or "learn
/// more" is a purchase path, and steering a user to a browser to buy is what earns a
/// rejection. `/terms` and `/privacy` are the legal disclosures Guidelines 1.2 and
/// 5.1.1 REQUIRE, they carry no price, no plan and no sign-up form, and Apple's own
/// metadata fields name the same two URLs. Removing them to satisfy 3.1.3(b) would
/// breach 1.2, which is the trade this comment exists to stop being re-litigated.

/// copy of either string inside the view would let the button and the page disagree
/// the first time one was reworded. ``sentence`` is the whole line as a reader sees
/// it and is what `SignInTermsCopyTests` pins.
///
/// ⚠️ THE FRAGMENTS CARRY THEIR OWN SPACES rather than relying on an `HStack`'s
/// spacing, so the composed sentence is the literal a test can compare. A layout
/// container's gap is not in the string.
