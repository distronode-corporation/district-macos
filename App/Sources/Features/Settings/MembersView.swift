/// than inconsistent.

/// ⛔ THE REMOVE IS CONFIRMED AND THE CONFIRMATION NAMES THE CONSEQUENCE. Removing
/// someone ends their access to every call, contact and conversation in this workspace
/// on their next request, and re-adding them is a new row rather than an undo.
///
/// ⛔ THE RENAME BOX STARTS EMPTY AND SAYS SO. Nothing this client can read returns the
/// workspace's current name, so a box seeded from what we know could only be blank ,
/// which is the shape that saves a blank over a real value.
