/// ⚠️ THE TWO READS RUN CONCURRENTLY AND FAIL INDEPENDENTLY. A workspace whose mode
/// read fails still gets its document list; the mode selector is withheld rather than
/// the screen failing, because a selector seeded from a guess is how a data-residency
/// setting gets changed by accident.
///
/// ⚠️ THE DELETE IS ABSENT BECAUSE ``KnowledgeRepository`` HAS NO METHOD FOR IT.
/// `deleteDocument` is in `UntypedEndpoints`; its fixture is gated and nothing decodes
/// it. Worth knowing before assuming this screen lost a button:
/// the route also answers `{success:true}` when nothing matched, so a client that gets
