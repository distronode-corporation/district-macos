/// One persona audition: a real, billed call to this workspace's own voice agent,
/// answering as the form on screen describes it.
///
/// ⛔ NOTHING HERE IS A DRY RUN, AND EVERY RULE IN THIS TYPE FOLLOWS FROM THAT. The
/// token invites the agent into a `preview_<workspaceId>_<uuid>` room on the
/// workspace's own pipeline and its own media node, where it answers with speech
/// recognition, a model and speech synthesis exactly as it would on a telephone call.
/// The route is capped at 10/min per WORKSPACE, it is not idempotent, and the spend
/// lands downstream in the agent rather than in the handler, so a failure is FINAL
/// here (a button, never a retry), a second tap while one is running is dropped, and
/// the control stays disabled for a few seconds after one ends.
///
/// ⛔ IT CLAIMS THE DEVICE'S AUDIO THROUGH ``CallStack`` AND CONFORMS TO ``RoomAudio``,
/// WHICH IS THE WHOLE OF ITS ARBITRATION. One process owns one `AVAudioSession`: the
/// softphone's ``AudioSessionCoordinator`` configures it while CallKit activates it,
/// and ``RoomEngine/connect(url:token:)`` hands it back to the SDK's own automation.
/// Both are correct for their own case and cannot both be right at once. So a preview
/// is REFUSED while a call or a room is live, and an arriving call ENDS the preview ,
/// `CallStack.beginCall()` awaits `endRoom(.telephoneCall)` before it builds the call's
/// engine, which reaches ``yieldAudio(_:)`` here. Without the claim, the refusal would
/// point one way only, which is the shape that makes a private customer call audible
/// in a meeting.
///
/// ⛔ IT NEVER REACHES ``CallKitBridge``. An audition is not a telephone call and must
/// not appear in the system's call list, be resumable from it, or count against the
/// one-call-at-a-time the provider declares to the OS.
///
/// ⚠️ THE CLAIM IS ALSO THIS OBJECT'S LIFETIME. The sheet can be dismissed, and a
/// workspace switch or a sign-out can destroy the screen outright; the claim is what
/// keeps a publishing microphone owned by something rather than stranded. The other
/// half of that bargain is that every exit path ends the session, see ``end()``,
/// ``yieldAudio(_:)`` and the view's `onDisappear`.
