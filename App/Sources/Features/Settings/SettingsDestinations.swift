/// The one place a ``SettingsSection`` becomes a screen.
///
/// ⛔ ITS OWN SWITCH RATHER THAN EIGHT MORE ARMS IN ``RouteDestinations``, AND THAT IS
/// A LINT CEILING AS WELL AS A READABILITY ONE. `swiftlint --strict` caps cyclomatic
/// complexity at 10 and that switch is already at its limit with the whole route table
/// grouped; adding a section per arm there would break it, and grouping the sections
/// would defeat the exhaustiveness the outer switch exists to keep. The outer table
/// stays one line per destination FAMILY, this one is one line per section, and both
/// stay exhaustive, a new ``SettingsSection`` case fails to compile here until someone
/// decides what it shows.
///
/// ⚠️ `hub` AND `scheduling` ARE THE TWO ARMS THAT ARE NOT A FORM. `hub` is the list
/// itself, and `scheduling` is unreachable in practice because ``SettingsHubView``
/// navigates to `Route.scheduling` rather than to this section, the screen already
/// exists and resolves `canManage` from the server's own status route, which is a
/// better gate than a role string. It is handled anyway rather than grouped away,
/// because a `Route` restored from a back stack or arriving from a deep link can carry
/// any section, and falling through to the wrong screen is worse than showing the hub.
