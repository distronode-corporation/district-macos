/// ⛔ AND AN ABSENT ALLOWLIST MEANS EVERY TOOL IS ON, WHICH IS A FACT ABOUT THE SERVER
/// THAT THIS CLIENT MAY DISPLAY AND MAY NOT WRITE DOWN. A brand-new workspace has
/// `toolConfig: null`; the web reads that as its own nine defaults enabled and may
/// materialise them on a first save, because the web form and the route ship from the
/// same deploy and cannot disagree about what "every tool" is. An installed build can
/// be months behind, so the same materialisation here DELETES whatever it has not
/// learned to name: a catalog one id short of the server's default set drops that id
/// permanently on the first save. ``storedTools`` therefore has NO fallback, and a section
/// with nothing stored is drawn read-only rather than saved from a guess. Reading nil
/// as an empty allowlist and saving would be the other, louder version of the same
