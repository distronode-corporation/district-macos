/// The dynamic-persona rules: how the agent changes voice or engine depending on who is
/// calling. Ported from Android's `RoutingRulesScreen.kt`, editor included.
///
/// ⛔ THE SAVE REPLACES THE WHOLE LIST, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS.
/// `POST workspace/routing-rules` replaces the stored array
/// wholesale, the column is `Json`, and its per-rule schema is `.passthrough()`, so:
///
///   1. every row carries its STORED object and overwrites only the six keys this form
///      owns, and a row this build cannot read is sent back byte-identically rather than
///      rebuilt or dropped (``RoutingRuleDraft``);
///   2. an unrecognised row is SHOWN and is not offered an editor, because an editor
///      over it would have to invent those six keys;
///   3. a save that would send an empty array is CONFIRMED, naming what happens on the
///      next call rather than asking whether the operator is sure;
///   4. nothing is pre-validated against a guess. The per-workspace voice and engine
///      allow-list is invisible to this client, so the pickers offer the catalogue
///      `persona/options` publishes and a refusal is shown verbatim, it names the value.
///
/// ⚠️ AN EMPTY LIST IS A REAL ANSWER AND THE ORDINARY ONE. Most workspaces have no
/// dynamic rules and every caller hears the configured persona, which the empty state
/// says rather than implying something is missing.
///
/// ⚠️ A VIEWER NEVER REACHES THIS SCREEN: `workspace/config` excludes them server-side,
/// which is why ``RouteGate`` hides the row. The model still gates every write, because
/// a control that was not drawn is not a boundary.
