/// does not save nothing, it DELETES the transfer directory the voice agent routes
/// live callers through, or the agent's tool allowlist. ``failed`` therefore carries
/// no configuration: a screen in that state may offer a retry and nothing else.
///
/// ⚠️ ``ready`` HOLDS THE WHOLE ``WorkspaceConfig`` rather than the one section a
/// given screen edits, because the section is not the unit of safety. `allowedTools`
/// has to be carried back complete, including entries this client's catalog does not
/// know about.
