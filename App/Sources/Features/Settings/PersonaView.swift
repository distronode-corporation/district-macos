/// The persona an operator may edit from a phone, and the audition that proves it.
/// Ported from Android's `PersonaFormScreen.kt`, which has neither the pickers nor the
/// preview.
///
/// ⛔ NO FIELD AND NO SAVE BUTTON EXISTS WHEN THE CONFIGURATION DID NOT LOAD. That
/// absence is the feature, not an oversight in the layout: this whole surface's rule
/// is that a save is built on a successful read, and the load-failure branch below
/// renders a retry and nothing else. See the ⛔ on ``SettingsLoadFailureView``.
///
/// ⛔ THE ENGINE PANEL IS FILLED ONLY FROM THE SERVER'S CATALOGUE. Every field on it
/// COERCES rather than rejects server-side, an unrecognised `modelId` is silently
/// rewritten to `deepgram-pipeline`, an unrecognised `voice` is stored verbatim and
/// then replaced by the agent's own fallback at synthesis time, both with a 200, so
/// the choice is between offering free text that produces a persona nobody chose and
/// reading the catalogue the web derives its own pickers from. `persona/options` is that
/// catalogue, and ``PersonaEngineDraft`` is the only thing that may fill these
/// controls. ⛔ WHEN IT DOES NOT LOAD THE PANEL FALLS BACK TO SHOWING THE STORED VALUES
/// AND NOTHING ELSE, never to a built-in list, which would be the same drifting second
/// copy wearing a Swift literal.
///
/// ⛔ THE AVATAR ROW IS A STATUS AND NEVER A CONTROL. Turning video on starts a
/// billable Tavus stream, and App Store Review Guideline 3.1.3(b) plus the ⛔ on
/// `AiPersona.videoEnabled` both point the same way: nothing in this app writes it.
///
/// ⚠️ THE PREVIEW IS A SHEET AND A DELIBERATE PRESS. It mints a credential that invites
/// the voice agent into a room and starts burning speech and model minutes, so it is
/// never an effect of arriving on the screen.
