/// available way to find out whether the phase transitions, the arbitration and the
/// teardown are right. Everything above this protocol is ordinary code with a fake

/// ⛔ IT IS DELIBERATELY NARROWER THAN ``RoomEngine`` AND MUST STAY THAT WAY. There is
/// no camera member and no data channel here: a persona audition publishes a microphone
/// and subscribes to the agent's audio, and a seam that offered a camera would make
/// "audio only" a claim in a comment rather than a property of the type. ⚠️ `RoomEngine`
/// still HAS those members, this is a view onto it, not a different engine.
///
/// ⚠️ `RoomEngine` RATHER THAN `LiveKitCallEngine` IS NOT A PREFERENCE. `CallEngine`'s
/// `connect(url:token:)` takes no encryption key, by documented decision, and a
/// `preview_*` room is always end-to-end encrypted, a client that joined it
/// unencrypted would be the only such participant in the room, publishing and hearing
/// noise while every connection succeeded.
