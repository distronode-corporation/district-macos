/// The persona form's state machine. Ported from Android's `PersonaFormViewModel`.
///
/// ⛔ A FAILED LOAD PRODUCES NO EDITABLE STATE, AND THAT IS THIS CLASS'S ONE
/// NON-NEGOTIABLE PROPERTY. `PATCH workspace/persona` merges per field, so this
/// particular form is the gentler of the two savers on this surface, but the rule
/// is enforced here anyway, because the moment it is relaxed for the harmless case
/// somebody copies the shape onto the capability list, where the route REPLACES the
/// array wholesale and an empty form is a deletion. There is exactly one way to
/// reach ``SettingsConfigState/ready(_:)``, and it is a 200 from the config read.
///
/// ⛔ THE REQUEST CARRIES ONLY DIRTY FIELDS. The server preserves what a request
/// omits (`x !== undefined ? x : existing`), so this is how a phone saves a greeting
/// without overwriting the engine choice, the response-length map and the avatar
/// configuration with defaults it invented. ``JSONValue/object(_:)`` drops a nil
/// pair, so "not dirty" and "not on the wire" are the same thing by construction.
///
/// ⛔ AND THERE ARE TWO LOADS, NOT ONE, WITH DIFFERENT CONSEQUENCES FOR FAILING. The
/// configuration is the baseline every save is built on, so without it there is no
/// form at all. The VOCABULARIES (`persona/options`) decide only what the language and
/// answer-length controls may offer, so without them the three free-text fields stay
/// editable and those two fall back to showing the stored values and nothing else.
/// ⛔ THEY MUST NEVER FALL BACK TO A BUILT-IN CATALOGUE: every value a stale Swift list
/// offered would still be accepted, stored and then silently substituted by the agent,
/// with a 200 and nothing reporting it, which is the exact failure the options route
/// exists to retire.
///
/// ⚠️ AN EMPTY STRING IS SENT FOR THE THREE TEXT FIELDS AND NEVER FOR THE OTHERS.
/// Clearing a greeting is a real edit and the server stores `""` verbatim; clearing a
/// LANGUAGE would store an empty one and make the agent fall back to one nobody chose.
/// See the ⛔ on ``PersonaIdentityValues``.
///
/// ⛔ THE ENGINE, VOICE AND TUNING ARE THE VOICE STUDIO'S (``VoiceStudioModel``), a
/// sibling screen and never a child, so a stale persona form can never resend an engine id
/// the Studio changed. This form sends the stored engine id only beside an answer length,
/// where the route needs it as a key.
///
/// ⛔ A NEW LANGUAGE IS FOLLOWED BY FITTING A CHAIN OF THE MEMBER'S OWN TO IT
/// (``refit``), as the web form and district-linux do: a `custom-pipeline` chain whose ear
/// or voice does not speak the new language is one the service no longer accepts. The chain
/// is read from the Studio BEFORE the save (the config this form holds does not carry it),
/// and after a save that landed `VoiceStudioRefit` reads the Studio for the new language and,
/// when it no longer accepts the chain, moves it, saves it and reads it back.
///
/// ⚠️ THE ENRICHMENT CONSENT FLAG ALSO RIDES THIS ROUTE AND IS NOT EDITED HERE. It
/// lives on the capabilities screen, matching the web console, where the enrichment
/// form sits inside the capabilities tab and posts to `workspace/persona`.
