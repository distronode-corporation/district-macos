/// The dynamic-persona rules, editable.
///
/// ⛔ TWO FACTS ABOUT THE ROUTE WOULD MAKE A NAIVE EDITOR UNSAFE, AND EACH IS HANDLED
/// RATHER THAN WAIVED.
///
///   1. `POST workspace/routing-rules` REPLACES the stored array wholesale, the column
///      is `Json`, and its per-rule schema is `.passthrough()`, the committed fixture
///      holds rows shaped `{id, match, action, target}` that the web's own rule builder
///      does not edit. A row rebuilt from six typed fields would strip the rest and be
///      answered 200, which is a silent deletion INSIDE somebody's rule rather than of
///      one. ``RoutingRuleDraft`` carries the original object and overwrites only the
///      six keys this form owns, and a row it cannot read is sent back byte-identically.
///   2. The only server-side validation is a per-workspace voice and model allow-list
///      that this client cannot see. So the editor does NOT pre-validate against a
///      guess: it offers the catalogue `persona/options` publishes, sends what was
///      chosen, and shows the server's refusal verbatim, that refusal names the value.
///
/// ⛔ AND AN INTENTIONALLY EMPTY SAVE IS CONFIRMED RATHER THAN REFUSED. An operator who
/// wants no rules must be able to say so; what must not happen is an empty array going
/// out because a row was fumbled. ``wouldSaveEmpty`` is what the view asks first.
///
/// ⚠️ THE VOCABULARY READ IS ALLOWED TO FAIL WITHOUT TAKING THE SCREEN WITH IT. A rule's
/// field, operator, value and instruction need no catalogue; only its voice and engine
/// pickers do, and those fall back to showing what is stored. A built-in list is not an
/// option here for the same reason it is not on the persona form: the route stores
/// whatever it is sent.
