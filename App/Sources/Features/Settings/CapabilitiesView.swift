/// What the agent may DO on a call, plus the enrichment consent flag. Ported from
/// Android's `CapabilitiesScreen.kt`.
///
/// ⛔ TWO SECTIONS WITH TWO SAVE BUTTONS AND TWO ROUTES, MIRRORING THE WEB
/// DELIBERATELY. The capability allowlist is `PATCH workspace/tools` and the
/// enrichment opt-in is a persona field on `PATCH workspace/persona`, exactly as
/// `EnrichmentSettingsForm` sits inside the web's capabilities tab. One button
/// writing through both would be one tap with two failure modes, and the
/// wholesale-replace one would be the half nobody was thinking about.
///
/// ⛔ NO TOGGLE AND NO SAVE EXISTS WHEN THE CONFIGURATION DID NOT LOAD, and on THIS
/// screen that absence is load-bearing rather than tidy: the allowlist route replaces
/// the stored array with exactly what it receives, so a form rendered from nothing and
/// saved would switch the agent's capabilities off and be answered `{success:true}`.
///
/// ⛔ AND THERE IS A THIRD STATE BETWEEN THOSE TWO: the configuration loaded and
/// carries NO stored allowlist, which is where every workspace starts. The switches are
/// drawn (that is the answer to "what may my agent do") and none of them is editable,
/// because a first save would replace the stored list with exactly the ids THIS BUILD
/// can name. See the ⛔ on ``CapabilitiesModel/storedTools``; without it this screen
/// would delete `send_sms` from every workspace whose operator opened it.
///
/// ⛔ THE OTHER `toolConfig` FIELDS ARE DISPLAYED AND NEVER SENT. The calendar id, the
/// support number and the sender identity are merged per field server-side AND written
/// when present, so `""` would CLEAR them, which is what an empty box on a phone
/// produces.
