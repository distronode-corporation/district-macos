/// The workspace settings hub: which section to open. Ported from Android's
/// `WorkspaceSettingsScreen.kt`, whose header decisions are carried over rather than
/// re-derived.
///
/// ⛔ IT HOLDS NO STATE AND MAKES NO REQUEST. Each section loads its own
/// configuration when it opens, so a hub-level read would be a second copy of the
/// same row going stale between screens, and on this surface a stale copy is the
/// input to a wholesale-replace save.
///
/// ⛔ EVERY ROW IS GATED BY PRESENCE, NOT BY ENABLEMENT, AND THE GATE IS
/// ``RouteGate`` RATHER THAN A RULE RE-DERIVED HERE. A disabled row that 403s on tap
/// is worse than no row, and a second copy of "who may open what" is how the two
/// copies come to disagree. ``RouteGate/gate(for:role:)`` already knows that the
/// config-backed sections and the Voice Studio are hidden from a viewer (their reads
/// exclude one: the payloads carry staff transfer numbers, the operator's own prompt and
/// the workspace's engine) while
/// knowledge, messaging and members are merely `partial` (their reads admit a viewer
/// and their screens gate their own controls).
///
/// ⛔ A VIEWER REACHES THIS SCREEN AND GETS TWO ROWS OUT OF EIGHT. That is the whole
/// point of the gate above rather than a degenerate case of it: `workspace/knowledge`,
/// `workspace/knowledge-mode` and `workspace/messaging` all admit a viewer by design,
/// so hiding the hub in front of them would hide screens a viewer is entitled to. The
/// config-backed rows, the Voice Studio row and the members row stay hidden, which
/// is what Android admits and not one row more. The two screens they DO reach gate
/// their own controls, the reads admit a viewer and every write on both refuses one ,
/// so "the row was drawn" never means "the button will work".
///
/// ⚠️ NO `NavigationStack` OF ITS OWN. ``ShellView`` provides one per tab and
/// registers `navigationDestination(for: Route.self)` on it exactly once; SwiftUI
/// resolves that by TYPE, so a second registration here would be a runtime coin toss
/// rather than a compile error.
