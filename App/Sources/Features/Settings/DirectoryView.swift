/// Who the agent can put a live caller through to. Ported from Android's
/// `DirectoryEditorScreen.kt`, editor included.
///
/// ⛔ THE SAVE REPLACES THE WHOLE LIST. `PATCH workspace/directory` writes
/// `callDirectory: (callDirectory || [])`, so the array this
/// form produces becomes the COMPLETE list of humans the voice agent will transfer a live
/// caller to, and an empty one removes every target while answering `{success:true}`. There
/// is no undo and no export. Three things make that safe enough to offer:
///
///   1. the form can only exist on a successful `workspace/config` read
///      (``SettingsConfigState`` has no case for "we could not load, here is an empty form
///      anyway"), so it never opens on a blank baseline;
///   2. every row carries its STORED object and overwrites only the three keys this screen
///      owns, so a key nothing here models survives the round trip, see
///      ``DirectoryDraft``;
///   3. a save that would send an empty array is CONFIRMED, naming what happens on the
///      next call rather than asking whether the operator is sure.
///
/// ⛔ `type` IS THE FIELD THIS SCREEN EXISTS FOR AS MUCH AS THE REST. `"app"` makes a
/// transfer RING THE PHONE instead of dialling a PSTN number, and it has never been
/// settable from any UI on any platform. ⚠️ An ABSENT `type` is shown as "Phone number" and
/// stays absent unless somebody picks one, writing the default in would rewrite every
/// tenant's stored config to say what it already meant.
///
/// ⚠️ HALF-FILLED ROWS ARE SHOWN, FLAGGED, AND SAVED. The server's schema has both fields
/// `.nullish()`, so a row with a name and no number is legal and already exists, it is a
/// transfer target the agent cannot use, which is exactly what an operator is here to find
/// out. Dropping it on their behalf would be a deletion nobody asked for. An ENTIRELY blank
/// row is dropped, because that is the Add button pressed and abandoned.
///
/// ⚠️ A VIEWER NEVER REACHES THIS SCREEN: `workspace/config` excludes them server-side
/// (the payload carries staff transfer numbers), which is why ``RouteGate`` hides the row
/// outright rather than offering it read-only. The model still gates every write, because a
/// control that was not drawn is not a boundary.
