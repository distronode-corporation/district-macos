/// Create or edit one carrier account. Ported from Android's
/// `MessagingAccountForm.kt`.
///
/// ⛔ AN ORDINARY EDIT TYPES NO CREDENTIAL AT ALL, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS
/// FORM CAN EXIST. The read carries no secret, so there is nothing to pre-fill with;
/// the route reads a blank or absent secret as "keep the stored ciphertext", so leaving
/// the boxes alone preserves what is stored. ⛔ EXCEPT ON A PROVIDER CHANGE, where the
/// stored secrets are DISCARDED rather than reused, so a blank box there means "store
/// nothing", which is what ``MessagingDraft/secretsRequired`` makes the form say.
///
/// ⛔ THE PROBE IS NOT A SAVE AND THE FORM NEVER SAVES ON THE STRENGTH OF ONE. It sends
/// plaintext, unsaved credentials to a route that makes one authenticated third-party
/// call per request from the platform's own egress; it is offered only when every field
/// for the provider is filled, and its three outcomes are three different sentences.
///
/// ⛔ THE DRAFT LIVES ON THE MODEL AND IS READ THROUGH IT ON EVERY RENDER, NOT COPIED
/// INTO A STORED PROPERTY. A stored copy would be the value as it was when the sheet
/// was presented, and every keystroke after that would be written into the model and
/// then read back from a snapshot that never moved, a form that appears to ignore
/// typing. ``MessagingModel`` is `@Observable`, so reading it here is what re-renders
/// this view.
///
/// ⛔ NO `NavigationStack` AND NO TOOLBAR, matching ``CreateContactSheet``: a stack here
/// would be a second `Route.self` destination registration waiting to happen, and the
/// sheet has nowhere to navigate to.
