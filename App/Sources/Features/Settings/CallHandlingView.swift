/// How this workspace answers a call, and how long the app rings before the agent takes
/// it.
///
/// ⛔ THE THREE MODES ARE WORDED AS WHAT HAPPENS ON THE NEXT CALL, NEVER AS THE WIRE
/// VALUES. `ai_first`, `ai_then_app` and `app_first` are what the route validates; an
/// operator choosing between them is deciding whether their own telephone rings, and
/// ``SettingsCopy/callsModeAiThenApp`` and its two siblings are the only place that is
/// said. Anything that put an enum name on screen here would be a control nobody can
/// use.
///
/// ⛔ A VIEWER REACHES THIS SCREEN READ-ONLY, WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE CALL FROM PERSONA AND
/// CAPABILITIES. `GET workspace/call-handling` admits all three roles, nothing in that
/// payload is a staff phone number, it is a mode and a number of seconds, while the PATCH
/// excludes a viewer. So the row is drawn, the controls are not, and the model re-checks
/// the role at each write's call site anyway, because a control that was not drawn is not
/// a boundary.
///
/// ⛔ THE RING STEPPER SAYS WHEN IT DOES NOTHING. On "the agent answers everything"
/// nothing rings, so the value is stored and never used; without
/// ``SettingsCopy/callsRingNote`` an operator who set it and heard no ring would conclude
/// the setting is broken.
///
/// ⚠️ NO `savedButStale` BANNER IS POSSIBLE HERE and the absence is deliberate rather
/// than an omission: the PATCH echoes what it wrote, so ``CallHandlingModel`` adopts its
/// own response and never re-reads. That is why ``SettingsSaveNotice`` is given no
/// `onReread`.
///
/// ⚠️ NO `NavigationStack` OF ITS OWN. ``ShellView`` provides one per tab and registers
/// `navigationDestination(for: Route.self)` on it exactly once; SwiftUI resolves that by
/// TYPE, so a second registration here would be a runtime coin toss rather than a compile
/// error.
