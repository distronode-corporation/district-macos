/// They live apart to keep this file under the 500-line `file_length` ceiling that
/// `swiftlint --strict` makes an error, not because they belong to something else.
///
/// ⛔ NOTHING HERE IS EVER REPLAYED. ``load()`` is the only idempotent call on the
/// type; every write is invoked from a press and from nothing else. A replayed create
/// would mint a second carrier account and a replayed delete would remove whichever
/// account had since taken the id's place in the operator's head.
///
/// ⛔ EVERY WRITE RE-CHECKS THE ROLE AT ITS OWN CALL SITE rather than trusting that the
/// UI hid the control. ``canEdit`` is a UX gate; the server's `requireWorkspaceRole` is
/// the boundary. A viewer reaches this screen, so "the button was not drawn" is the
/// kind of assumption that survives until someone adds a keyboard shortcut.
///
/// ⛔ A WRITE THAT LANDED RE-READS, AND A FAILED RE-READ DOES NOT OVERWRITE THE WRITE'S
/// OWN NOTICE. They are separate fields precisely so "the change landed" and "we could
/// not re-read the list" can both be true and both be said. Telling an operator their
/// change failed when only the read did invites them to make it again, and on this
/// surface "again" can mean a second carrier account. That outcome has a name,
/// ``SettingsSaveState/savedButStale(_:)``, and the screen must draw it outside
/// `case .ready`: ``read()`` sets `load` to `.failed` whatever it was called for, so a
/// notice drawn only inside `.ready` would turn a successful create followed by a failed
/// GET into nothing but "Could not load this workspace's configuration".
///
/// ⛔ A WRITE THAT WAS REFUSED DOES NOT RE-READ, EXCEPT FROM THE THREE ROW CONTROLS.
/// This is ``SettingsConfigGateway/commit(_:)``'s rule and the reasoning is its: nothing
/// was written, so the list on screen is still correct, and a second request only gives
/// a flaky network the chance to turn a clear refusal into a load failure. ⚠️ THE ROW
/// CONTROLS ARE THE EXCEPTION because their commonest refusal is a **404**, which means
/// the list itself is stale and re-reading is the fix. ``saveAccount()`` is not, and the
/// difference is its FORM: it is the only write whose sheet is still open afterwards,
/// so a load failure there disables a form holding unsaved carrier secrets whose only
/// escape discards them.
///
/// ⛔ EVERY WRITE HOLDS ITS SAVE STATE AT `saving` UNTIL ITS RE-READ HAS FINISHED.
/// Settling the state first would leave ``busy`` false for the whole GET, with every row
/// control live against a list still showing pre-write rows, beside "Saved.". A deleted
/// account would stay drawn with a working Delete for the length of the read, and
/// pressing it would send a request the route 404s. ⚠️ THAT WINDOW IS ALSO THIS TYPE'S
/// ONLY SEQUENCING. There is no generation counter on the reads and none is needed:
/// every write is gated on ``canEditNow``, which is gated on ``busy``, so two of these
/// can no longer be in flight at once and two responses cannot land out of order.
///
/// ⚠️ THE UPSERT'S RESPONSE IS NEVER USED TO PATCH THE LIST. It echoes ids only, and
/// the route trims the label, may substitute a generated provider name and filters the
/// numbers; a row rebuilt from the request would show what was typed rather than what
