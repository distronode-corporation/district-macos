/// three buttons that 403, and the first for both would hide a rename they are entitled

/// last-administrator refusal usually means the operator's copy of who holds `agency`
/// is out of date, and leaving the stale list up invites the same refusal again.
///
/// ⛔ AND THE WRITE HOLDS ITS SAVE STATE AT `saving` UNTIL THAT RE-READ HAS FINISHED.
/// Settling the state first would leave ``busy`` false for the whole GET, with every
/// picker and Remove button live against a roster still showing pre-write rows, beside
/// "Saved.": a removed member would stay drawn with a working Remove for the length of
/// the read. ⚠️ That window is also this type's only sequencing: every write
/// is gated on ``busy``, so two of them cannot be in flight and two roster reads cannot
/// land out of order. No generation counter is needed and none is here.
///
/// ⛔ A RE-READ THAT FAILS AFTER A WRITE THAT LANDED IS
/// ``SettingsSaveState/savedButStale(_:)`` AND LEAVES THE ROSTER ALONE. The membership
/// change IS stored; the list is merely out of date. Replacing it with a load-failure
/// view would throw away both a usable roster and the only record that the write
/// succeeded, and on this screen that invites the operator to make the change again.
///
/// ⛔ THE RENAME FIELD DOES NOT PREFILL, AND THAT IS THE LOAD-FIRST RULE APPLIED
/// HONESTLY RATHER THAN A MISSING FEATURE. Nothing this client can call returns the
/// workspace's current name: the roster does not carry it, `workspace/config` excludes
/// it, and the only read that has it fans out across every region. A field seeded from
/// nothing is exactly the shape that turns "the load failed" into "the operator saved a
