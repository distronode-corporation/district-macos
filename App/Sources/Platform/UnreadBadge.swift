/// The number on the app icon (on the Mac, the Dock icon's badge).
///
/// ⛔ IT IS ONLY EVER SET FROM A COUNT SOMEBODY ACTUALLY READ, AND THAT IS THE
/// WHOLE TYPE. A badge is a claim about the account, so zero has to mean "nothing
/// unread" and must never mean "we could not ask". There is deliberately no
/// `refresh()` here and no failure path: a caller whose read failed simply does not
/// call, which leaves the last known number on the icon rather than replacing it
/// with a lie. Adding a `set(_:)` overload that took an optional, or a `Result`,
/// would put that decision back at every call site.
///
/// ⛔ `UNUserNotificationCenter.setBadgeCount(_:)`, as on iOS (macOS 14, this app's floor,
/// has it), rather than `NSApp.dockTile.badgeLabel`: it honours the badge permission the
/// person granted with notifications, which a Dock tile label would ignore.
///
/// ⚠️ `@MainActor`, AND SYNCHRONOUS. Every caller is main-actor isolated
/// already (``PushRegistrar`` and ``InboxModel`` on the Mac), so the isolation
/// costs nothing; and staying synchronous keeps overload resolution away from the
/// `async throws` variant of the same selector, which would drag a `try` into every
/// call site for an error nothing can act on.
///
/// ⚠️ THE COUNT IS THE SELECTED WORKSPACE'S, NOT THE ACCOUNT'S. One icon cannot
/// carry a number per workspace, and every surface that produces one here is scoped
/// to the workspace stored in ``WorkspaceSelectionStore``. Switching workspace
/// re-badges on that workspace's next load.
