/// The telemetry socket over `URLSessionWebSocketTask`: the one piece of `DistrictLive`
/// that lives in the app.
///
/// ⛔ IT MOVES BYTES AND DECIDES NOTHING. Every rule about the socket (what to offer, what
/// to accept, when to renew, when to give up) is `TelemetryConnection`'s, in
/// district-core-swift, tested on Linux. `TelemetrySocketTransport`'s documentation lists
/// what an adapter owes it, and each item is answered here:
///
/// - `connect(to:subprotocols:)` returns once the handshake completed (the delegate's
///   `didOpenWithProtocol`), with the protocol the server selected, and throws for a
///   refused handshake or a network failure.
/// - ⛔ THE SUBPROTOCOLS ARE OFFERED EXACTLY AS GIVEN, IN ORDER: the protocol version
///   first, then the credential (`distronode.token.<jwt>`). `URLSessionWebSocketTask`
///   sends them as one `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header in the order of the array, and
///   reordering them would let a server that selects the first offer echo the credential
///   back. Nothing here builds, filters or sorts the list.
/// - ⛔ LIVENESS IS SURFACED AS `.heartbeat`. `URLSessionWebSocketTask` answers the
///   server's pings itself and never hands them to `receive()`, so a quiet, healthy socket
///   delivers nothing at all, and the core's 90 s silence watchdog would drop every quiet
///   socket. So the socket sends its own ping every ``pingIntervalMilliseconds`` and
///   reports each pong as a heartbeat. See ``URLSessionTelemetrySocket``.
/// - ⛔ THE SERVER'S CLOSE CODE IS REPORTED as `.closed(code:reason:)`, from the delegate's
///   `didCloseWith` or from `closeCode` once `receive()` throws, because 4401 ("mint a
///   new credential") and 4403 ("stop") are the protocol. A close with no status is 1005.
///
/// ⚠️ ONE `URLSession` PER SOCKET, invalidated when the socket closes. A session retains
/// its delegate until it is invalidated, so a shared session with per-socket delegates
/// would either leak every delegate or route one socket's handshake to another's waiter.
