/// The one place in this app that talks to the LiveKit SDK.
///
/// ⛔ THIN BY POLICY, EXACTLY LIKE THE KOTLIN `LiveKitCallEngine`. Every line here
/// needs a device and a live socket to exercise, so it can carry no decision: the
/// state machines that decide anything are ``SoftphoneSession`` and
/// ``IncomingCallController`` in `DistrictCall`, where they are tested on Linux with
/// no media server. This class forwards, and it maps SDK callbacks onto
/// ``CallEngineEvent``. Anything that could be a pure function belongs on the other
/// side of the seam.
///
/// ⛔ ONE ENGINE PER CALL. ``CallEngine``'s own note says why: the engine holds a live
/// socket and a claim on the device's audio route, and a LiveKit `Room` does not
/// support a second `connect` after it has disconnected. This type builds its `Room`
/// once, in `init`, and is discarded with the call.
///
/// ⚠️ ``events`` IS READ EXACTLY ONCE, BY THE FEATURE MODEL THAT OWNS THE CALL, it is
/// handed over by ``CallStack/beginCall()``, and the reader is the dialer's model.
/// `AsyncStream` hands each element to a single consumer, so a second `for await`
/// would SPLIT the events between two readers rather than mirroring them, and the
/// reducer would silently miss half of them.
///
/// ⚠️ THE STREAM IS NEVER FINISHED. ``disconnect()`` is not the end of the events: the
/// SDK reports `didDisconnectWithError` afterwards and that is what carries the
/// reason. The owner stops reading when its reducer reaches a terminal phase, and the
/// continuation dies with this object.
///
/// ⚠️ `@unchecked Sendable` BECAUSE ``CallEngine`` REQUIRES `Sendable` AND NOTHING HERE
/// IS ISOLATED. Every stored property is a `let`; the only mutable state in the whole
/// path is inside the `Room`, which the SDK owns.
///
/// ⚠️ PORTED FROM district-ios WITHOUT ITS AUDIO-SESSION HALF. macOS has no
/// `AVAudioSession` and LiveKit has no session automation there to turn off, so there is
/// no second owner to keep out; the microphone and speaker are chosen through LiveKit's
/// `AudioManager` (``AudioDevices``) instead, and the engine applies that choice before
/// it joins. ``CallEngineEvent/audioRouteChanged(_:)`` is never emitted: a Mac has no
/// earpiece to route away from, and the chosen output is the route.
