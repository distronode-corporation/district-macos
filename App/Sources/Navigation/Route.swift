/// Every push destination in the app, seeded in full so that a feature
/// adds files under `Features/<Name>/` and changes ONE line in
/// ``RouteDestinations``.
///
/// ⛔ EVERY WORKSPACE-SCOPED CASE CARRIES ITS `workspaceId`, AND THAT IS NOT
/// REDUNDANCY. Reading the active workspace from ``WorkspaceSessionModel`` at render
/// time would be shorter, but a destination restored from a `NavigationPath` after
/// the app is killed would then render against whatever the session happened to hold
/// by then, or against nothing. Carrying it in the value makes each destination
/// self-describing, which is also what a push deep link needs. The Android client
/// carries the same rule in its nav host.
///
/// ⛔ AND THE ROLE TRAVELS WITH IT FOR THE SAME REASON, wherever the destination has
/// something to gate or something to word. It is `Optional` because
/// ``WorkspaceRole/fromWire(_:)`` fails CLOSED: nil means "the role could not be
/// established", never "assume client". See ``RouteGate``.
///
/// ⛔ SIGN-IN IS NOT A ROUTE. Whether a session exists is derived state, not a
/// navigation question. Putting sign-in in a back stack means owning the invariant
/// "you may never navigate back into the app after signing out", which is exactly
/// what a back stack quietly violates. ``RootView`` chooses between the shell and
/// the sign-in screen instead.
///
/// ⚠️ Case names match Android's `Routes` constants; the mapping is named in each
/// comment so a change on either client is greppable from the other.
///
/// ⚠️ `Sendable` IS STATED RATHER THAN LEFT TO INFERENCE. Swift would infer it for an
/// internal enum whose payloads are all `Sendable`, and it does hold today
/// (`String`, ``WorkspaceRole`` and ``SettingsSection`` each are), but the
/// conformance is load-bearing the moment a value of this type is a stored property
/// of a `Sendable` struct, which it now is (``PushRouteAction/route``). Written out,
/// a future case carrying a non-`Sendable` payload fails HERE, where the reason is
/// visible, rather than at that unrelated struct's declaration.
