/// ``SettingsSection`` is, which is what makes a back press from a booking land on
/// the bookings list and the press after it land on the hub. One ``Route/scheduling``
/// case covers the whole family.
///
/// ⛔ THE TWO DRILL-DOWNS ARE CASES OF THIS ENUM RATHER THAN `Route` CASES OF THEIR
/// OWN, WHICH IS WHERE THIS TYPE DIVERGES FROM ``SettingsSection``. That one is a
/// `String` enum because every settings section is a leaf; an event type and a booking
/// are each addressed by an identifier, so the alternative was two more `Route` cases
/// and two more arms in ``RouteDestinations``, which is at SwiftLint's 60-line
/// ceiling. The cost is that this cannot be `CaseIterable` or `RawRepresentable`, and
/// ``listed`` plus ``pathSegment`` carry what those would have given.
///
/// ⛔ AND BOTH DRILL-DOWNS ARE SAFE TO RESTORE FROM A `NavigationPath`, which is the
/// property that permits them to be destinations at all. Arriving at either one runs
/// an idempotent GET and nothing else, the same argument ``Route/deskTicket`` makes,
/// and the opposite of ``Route/dialer``, whose absent in-call destination exists so a
/// restored back stack cannot place a second billable call.
///
/// ⚠️ THE SLUG AND THE ID ARE THE SERVER'S OWN AND ARE NEVER REBUILT. An event type is
/// addressed by SLUG because `eventTypes.get` takes one (`SchedulingEventType/slug`),
/// and a booking by ID because `bookings.answers` does; carrying the other half of
/// either pair would mean deriving the server's key from a display value.
